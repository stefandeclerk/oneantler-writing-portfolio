    blurb:
      "Twitter's investment in SoundCloud may be a sign that streaming has finally matured into its own.",
    body: "Twitter recently invested a large chunk of money into SoundCloud. It may well be a sign that streaming has grown from a relative gimmick to a legitimate player in the way people consume music. \n\nArguably the biggest news in music right now is Twitter’s $70 million investment in SoundCloud, bringing the music streaming service’s value to an estimated $700 million in this round of funding. \n\nWhile investing big money is becoming the norm in tech, especially apps, it’s by no means a small change, and it might just be a signal that music streaming is here to stay. While streaming media goes back more than 20 years, the advent of cheap broadband wireless internet and web-enabled smartphones made it possible for music streaming to come into its own, allowing fans to stream tracks wherever and whenever. This led to steady growth in music streaming services to the point where it has become commonplace, with more and more people logging on and jamming away, on the sidewalk, car, bus, and subway. However, digital music downloads have always been a headache for record companies that made most of their revenue from selling CDs, let alone losing sales to illegal downloads through services like Napster. What made their headache worse is the ability for fans to legitimately buy only the tracks they wanted on services like iTunes and Amazon, as opposed to full albums that generated bigger profits. In addition, digital downloads presented a unique challenge for record companies to pay royalties to artists, a problem made worse with streaming through services like Pandora, LastFM, and Spotify.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that technology changes the way people consume music – from the invention of the phonograph supplanting sheet music, the radio supplanting records, to digital downloads supplanting CDs, streaming is a natural progression in music consumption, enabled by the invention of the internet and faster data transfer speeds.\n\nWith most change comes a certain reluctance, confusion, and resistance, especially by those who profited and earned a living off of the way things had always been done. However, change is inevitable and so is adapting to change, and while Twitter’s massive investment in SoundCloud may seem like it’s just business, it’s also a clear sign that the change music streaming has brought about is finally being accepted and embraced. \n\nAnd when this happens, everyone wins. \n\nThis article originally appeared on NoticeSound.com\n\n",

    body: "Billabong’s latest range of board shorts are not only super stylish and comfortable but they’re also recycled.\n\nWith the summer holidays around the corner, iconic Australian surfwear brand Billabong recently launched its Spring/Summer 2014 men’s range in South Africa. This year’s collection of board shorts and walk shorts, however, comes with a bit of a twist – they’re recycled.\n\nFor its Recycler Series, Billabong uses lightweight stretch fabrics made from recycled PET bottles to create stylish and comfortable board shorts. About 25 PET bottles go into every pair of these limited edition boardies, and since the inception of the Recycler technology, the company has reused more than 60 million plastic bottles.\n\nThe collection includes a variety of styles, cuts, and patterns to fit any occasion, whether you’re ripping up the backline, body surfing with your kids, or just splashing around in the pool at home. Another addition to Billabong’s menswear collection this year is their innovative “Submersibles” walk short range. These nifty shorts are board shorts that are made to look like regular shorts or regular shorts you can swim in. Made using Recycler technology and featuring elasticated waistbands and side pockets, the Submersibles range includes a selection of vintage washes, chinos, and cargos making them perfect for the beach, a braai, or a run to the mall.\n\nBillabong is committed to its drive towards reducing the number of plastic bottles that litter the oceans and add to landfills, and its Recycler technology isn’t only limited to shorts. The company is moving towards incorporating litter-reducing technology into all of its garments in the future.\n\n",

    title: "Relationship between Risk & Return",
    blurb:
      "When making a decision on where to invest your money, it is important to understand both the potential returns and the risks.",
    body: "Every investment carries with it a certain amount of risk, and when making a decision on where to invest it is important to not only understand the potential returns (profit on your investment), but also the risk involved. Depending on how you look at it, risk can either mean the uncertainty of return or losing the money you invested. It is the price we pay for the potential for growth. Typically the greater the risk of an investment, the greater the potential for high returns, and vice versa. Examples of the different levels of risk include the following types of investments:\n\nLow risk, low return: Money Market\nMedium risk, medium return: Property\nHigh risk, high return: Stock Market\n\nWhen you’re investing, you need to decide what level of risk you are comfortable with, because you don’t want to lie awake at night worrying about your investments. For this reason, it is important to understand and accept the risk involved.\n\nThere are various types of risk, these include the following:\nCapital risk: potential loss of the money you invested\n\nMarket risk: potentially selling an investment at a low price\n\nInflation risk: the rate of return on your investment is lower than the inflation rate\n\nInterest risk: a drop in the interest rate of your investment\n\nLiquidity risk: limits on your access to funds in the investment over a certain period of time.\n\nLegislative risk: changes in laws and legislation regarding investments that may make certain investments less attractive.\n\nDefault risk: When the institution where your investment is held goes belly-up and fails.\n\nIn many cases, risk can be described as the chance that your investment does not achieve the returns you need to meet the financial goals you intended it for. It is for this reason that the different kinds of investments and their associated risk need to be understood when choosing an investment product that will meet your goals. Some investment products offer various levels of risk that can be applied at different times in the investment’s lifecycle – for instance when saving for your retirement you might want to choose to invest aggressively with high risk and lower the risk when you near your retirement age.\n\nOne thing that is very important when it comes to investing is time – the longer a risky investment is held, the lower the probability of losses. In general riskier investments are held for more than five years, and the higher the risk of the investment, the longer the period that it’s usually held.\n\nInvesting your hard-earned money can be a very stressful experience due to the risk involved with investing. The best way to approach it is to do your homework, familiarise yourself with the different levels of risk, decide on your goal for the investment and the level of risk you’re comfortable with, then invest mindfully.\n\nThis article was part of a content marketing campaign for a major financial services provider.\n\n",

    title: "Stop doing Kegel exercises!\n",
    blurb:
      "Does exercising your pelvic floor help improve your orgasm? Some health professionals believe you could be doing more harm.",
    body: "It’s believed that exercising your pelvic floor will help improve orgasm, but some health professionals believe you could be doing more harm.\n\nWe’re often told by health professionals and physical trainers alike that we should be clenching our way to a firmer pelvic floor, but some argue that these exercises are actually really bad for you.\n\nWe’re all familiar with the so-called “Kegel” exercises, widely believed to be beneficial to women (and men) for increasing the strength of the muscles in the pelvic floor, a part of the body that essentially holds the internal organs in place within the pelvis by stabilizing intra-abdominal pressure helps with controlling bowel movements and urinating (as well as incontinence), and facilitates the birthing process for women.\n\nDr. Arnold Kegel developed his now famous exercises in the late 1940s and early ’50s while trying to find a non-surgical treatment for urinary incontinence. This has since led to millions of women trying to stop peeing mid-stream (one of the exercises modern proponents suggest), especially when it was found that a “strong” pelvic floor enhances orgasm.\n\nBut are these exercises what Kegel really intended? While countering incontinence may have been his goal, it is highly unlikely that he had better orgasms in mind when he first laid women on their backs and asked them to clench his finger with their lady parts.\n\nNumerous studies have looked at whether strengthening the pelvic floor muscles is actually beneficial and have found that Kegel’s research does carry some weight in aiding the prevention of urinary continence, as well as prolapse (a condition where organs fall out of place and protrude through the vagina or the rectum) by staving off a condition called pelvic floor dysfunction. However, no research has indicated that doing “Kegels” can actually enhance orgasm.\n\nAdvocates of Kegel exercises have long cited his study as claiming that the exercises enhance orgasms in women, causing Sue, Jane, and Sally to start clenching their sphincters while sitting in traffic. Interestingly, in his groundbreaking 1952 study, Kegel writes: “…it has been found that dysfunction of the pubococcygeus [pelvic floor] exists in many women complaining of lack of vaginal feeling during coitus and that in these cases sexual appreciation can be increased by restoring the function of the pubococcygeus.” What exactly he meant by “sexual appreciation” is unclear, but considering it is mentioned in the context of women who can’t feel anything during sex, it is rather unlikely that he meant orgasm per se.\n\nMedical research papers are technical, and one can understand how this particular text could have been read out of context. Add more than 60 years' worth of broken telephones and it’s easy to see how Kegelers got to the enhanced orgasm claim. While not directly associated with Kegel’s research, the root of some of the claims may lie in the ancient Eastern sexual technique known as “pompoir” where a woman stimulates a man’s penis by using her vaginal muscles. The technique involves identifying the specific muscles and strengthening them in a way similar to Kegel exercises.\n\nThe challenge is to identify the specific muscles involved and not necessarily the entire pelvic floor. Identifying the correct muscles to strengthen was one of the challenges Kegel noted in his research. It is something many women struggle with, mistakenly exercising the abdominal and thigh muscles as a result.\n\nHowever, a storm is brewing within the physical therapy community over the actual benefits of “strengthening” the pelvic floor and whether these exercises may actually cause more problems. According to physiotherapist Elizabeth Rummer, the muscles in the pelvic floor are the only group of muscles that are working all the time. These muscles are taught and function like a trampoline or drum skin to rebound pressure from the internal organs. Due to their tautness, they are an exception to the principle “a toned muscle is a good muscle” and may actually become too tight if overworked. In fact, this can lead to symptoms such as urinary urgency and frequency, as well as pelvic floor dysfunction, the very condition Kegels are meant to counter.\n\nRummer notes that the pelvic floor muscles do not need to be further strengthened unless they have somehow been overstretched or injured in a way that’s made them weak, such as during childbirth, menopause, or as the result of surgery.\n\nIn recent times it has also become popular for men to exercise their pelvic floor muscles in the belief that it will lead to a stronger erection and result in better orgasms. Rummer refutes these beliefs and stresses that the only time it should be done is in the event of weak pelvic floor muscles or after a prostatectomy. Similar to women, over-tightening of these muscles may, in fact, have the opposite effect of what it was intended for, with no research supporting the notion of stronger erections and better orgasms, and over-doing it may result in the muscles not functioning properly.\n\nProfessionals like Elizabeth Rummer are still in their minority and face an uphill battle against more than 60 years worth of misunderstanding, but they’re slowly chipping away at what women have come to believe as gospel.\n\n",

    title: "Why more men should do yoga",
    blurb:
      "If you think yoga is something for women who sit around chanting 'ohmmm' while stretching a bit, you're in for a big surprise.",
    body: "From macho man to humble warrior\n\nThe popularity of yoga has increased exponentially since it first saw a revival in popularity in the 1980s. While it is not associated with esoteric barefoot hippies anymore, if you’re a guy you probably think that it is something for women who sit around chanting ‘ohmmm’ while stretching a bit – certainly not a very masculine activity. That can’t be further from the truth.\n\nHere are a couple of reasons why you should go from macho man to humble warrior:\n\nAstavakrasana this!\nYoga can be challenging, very challenging. Some of the poses require immense core strength and balance, such as Astavakrasana, or Eight Angle Pose, which is kind of like doing a push-up, but with your legs in the air and to your side and one arm in-between.\n\nEven the so-called basic poses can prove to be quite taxing, and most men I’ve spoken to said they were surprised at how challenging yoga actually was and that most had to be scraped off the studio floor afterward, completely forgetting about the bendy model in lycra in front of them.\n\nReal men Chaturanga\nIf you think that the guys I spoke to were half a chromosome away from being a girl, consider that guys like 11-time surfing world champion Kelly Slater, basketball behemoth Shaquille O’Neill, Red Hot Chili Peppers rocker Flea, and Hollywood tough guy Woody Harrelson all regularly practice yoga. Oh, and did I mention the entire All Blacks, rugby team?\n\nHow now, sacred cow?\nIn a post on MindBodyGreen, two-time Ultraman World Champion, Rich Roll, explained why yoga isn’t just for hot girls and middle-aged soccer moms and why he is a strong advocate for yoga among athletes.  Roll reiterates the most frequently cited benefits of yoga:\n\n1. Strength\nFrom core strength to a focus on specific muscle groups through each pose, yoga focuses on developing those essential muscles that you might have overlooked, thereby easing up the pressure on your more heavily utilized muscles and providing the important balance that yoga instructors harp on about.\n\n2. Balance\nA strengthened core and more balanced muscle structure mean that your coordination and general balance will improve, leading to better form and technique when playing sports.\n\n3. Flexibility\nAnother thing exercise experts are continually encouraging people to do more is stretching. It is believed that flexible joints and muscles are less likely to be prone to over-use injury. With regular practice, yoga will have you go from barely being able to touch your knees to comfortably putting your palms flat on the ground.\n\n4. Mental Control\nOne of the key focus areas of yoga is the mental aspect of the practice. While a debate is raging about whether yoga has religious connotations or not, the effect it has on mental strength is undeniable. The practice of yoga aims to create unity between mind, body, and spirit, which in essence means greater awareness and control over your body. Most yoga poses require a certain amount of focus, especially the balancing ones and the effect this has on activities outside of the yoga studio is quite remarkable, even at the office. We spend so much time taking care of the physical that we neglect our mental health, but in an angry and chaotic world of information overload, the mental strength gained from regular yoga practice becomes even more valuable.\n\nAdmittedly, yoga can be intimidating. The fear that you’ll look like a complete fool in downward-facing dog, the embarrassment of having a pool of sweat around your mat when the Kate Moss look-a-like next to you looks as fresh as she did at the beginning of class, not to mention looking at yourself in the mirror and realizing where all that craft beer has gone: it’s enough to fill a grown man with fear. However, yoga is intended to be non-judgemental and the focus is only on yourself and your own practice. After all, even the bendiest instructor started where you are, and if Shaq can do it…\n\nThis article originally appeared on iafrica.com\n\n",

    title: "Interview with Metallica's Kirk Hammett",
    blurb:
      "I spoke to guitarist Kirk Hammett about supergroups, surfing, and starting your own record label.",
    body: "The last time Metallica was in town they were part of the inaugural My Coke Fest (and all the various names that festival went through over the years), which saw them play the logistically disastrous Centurion Cricket Ground, a cold and rain-drenched ABSA Park in Durban and one of the last big gigs at the old Green Point Stadium in Cape Town. All of this was back in 2006.\n\nBack then the band promised to be back and seven years later they’ve made good on their promise and then some. Speculation over why the venue in Cape Town was changed shortly before the show aside, the band returned and blew audiences away with a number of intense, fast-paced shows that left everyone in utter awe that a band that’s been around for such a long time still has the energy to perform with such intensity.\n\nDuring a recent interview, guitarist Kirk Hammett revealed how the band constantly tries to keep their shows fresh and interesting by mixing up set lists, rearranging songs slightly, altering solos, and adding little things here and there. Mixing things up a bit isn’t just there to keep their live shows interesting for the audience, but also for the band themselves. Apart from bassist Rob Trujillo, who joined the band in 2003, the guys have been playing together for almost 30 years and therefore run the risk of getting bored playing the same material over and over. While Metallica is fortunate to have a vast catalog of material to choose from, there is only so much they can squeeze into a two-hour performance.\n\nLate last year the band formed their own record label called Blackened Recordings and proceeded to acquire the rights to all of their recordings, giving them full creative control. Not that they had been hamstrung in that department, as one so often hears of bands whose creativity suffers from heavy interference by the label they’ve signed to. Starting small in the ’80s, Metallica built a sizeable fanbase before signing to a major label which gave them some clout in terms of creativity from the start. Being one of the genre-defining leaders in the burgeoning thrash-metal scene in California also helped at keeping the label claws off their music. Over the years their fanbase has grown into an army of devout followers, almost guaranteeing sales and further helping to keep control firmly in their grasp.\n\nHaving full control over their material doesn’t come without its challenges since dealing with the business side of things now falls squarely in their laps – right when work has started on their brand new album. The traditional record company system has worked well for Metallica and Hammett feels it is still the best way to market and distribute an album, even though he says they’ve seen album sales drop by as much as 75 percent over the years (mainly) due to music piracy and the shrinking portion of income legal digital downloads generates.\n\nSpeaking to Hammett one realizes that Metallica has been very fortunate in having such a loyal following of fans. This is a band that positively benefited from the old record company model when album sales ruled and tours were part of the promotional process. In some respect, they’re old men who only know a system (or business model if you will) that is becoming less relevant every day, their well-known tussle with Napster serving as a stark reminder of this. In a way, they’ve been lucky. The system never really screwed them, they were at the right place at the right time, making the right kind of noise (literally) and part of Metallica’s genius lies in their ability to have kept fans coming back for more for almost three decades, even with their sound remaining largely unchanged.\n\nThis genius was on display at their recent shows in South Africa, where they had audiences hanging on every angry note. They are masters of their craft, pouring everything into every show in a way bands rarely do these days.\n\nFor all the power Metallica wields as a band over their fans, their hardcore image, and angry, heavy music, as individuals they are some of the nicest guys you are likely to meet and Kirk Hammett speaks candidly and with humility about the band he’s given his life to, about the fans and about surfing. It’s widely known that he’s a keen surfer and we speak at length about his bucket list of waves he’d still like to surf, having already ticked many of the waves most surfers can only dream of surfing off the list.\n\nLiving so close to the infamous Mavericks – a notoriously vicious break near San Francisco that is on par with the giant waves of Hawaii’s North Shore – he has considered surfing this angry monster but feels his physical condition won’t allow him the opportunity. His approach to surfing seems to be in line with his approach to playing the guitar; he meticulously practiced and was always up for a challenge.\n\nBefore the interview winds down the topic of supergroups and collaborations come up. A talented and experienced guitarist such as Kirk Hammett has undoubtedly had numerous opportunities to play with some of rock’s greatest musicians, but in an attitude that seems to sit at the heart of Metallica’s overall psyche, he’s defiant: I already play with the world’s best rhythm guitarist, the world’s best drummer, and the world’s best bassist – I get to play in a supergroup every day of my life, why would I want to play with anyone else?\n\n",

    blurb:
      "What happens when machines become more intelligent than humans? How far are we really from the so-called singularity?",
    body: "In Marvel's 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron film from 2015, the series introduces Ultron, arguably the Avengers’ fiercest enemy. In a lengthy article chronicling Ultron’s villainous history, Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos details how Ultron embodies our fears regarding artificial intelligence and what happens when machines become more intelligent than humans.\n\nThis tipping point where machines stop relying on humans, become self-sufficient, and overtake human intelligence is known as ‘the singularity’. Popular films like The Matrix, Terminator, and Blade Runner, all explore a futuristic scenario where humans are enslaved by machines and are seen as mere resources. It’s a scary world indeed, and with machines replacing an increasing number of previously human tasks, it becomes clear that it’s only a matter of time before Skynet takes over.\n\nThe concept of the singularity has been thrown around as a concept since the late 18th century, and more recently proponents like futurist Ray Kurzweil have predicted that with the rate of technological improvement and computers’ ever-increasing computing power, we’re only a couple of decades away from this catastrophic event.\n\nSome experts refute these claims saying that it’s very difficult to predict, as human intelligence isn’t just about the ability to string together billions of ones and zeroes in a fraction of a second, it includes creativity, the ability to think laterally, and also emotional intelligence. In fact, the debate around artificial intelligence is as much about philosophy as it is about technology. It’s one thing to create computational power, but what about morals, creativity, and sound judgment – how do you synthesize a soul?\n\nHowever, these are all human traits concerning matters that involve humans and aren’t necessarily key to the singularity. The concept of the singularity is based on self-reliance, self-improvement, and the superior intelligence of machines – it’s more about them (machines), than us. If the machines don’t need us anymore, why would they need to have these human qualities?\n\nDespite this, using advancement in computational power to predict the timing of the singularity is naïve, says forensic scientist Charles Brown* who holds a Ph.D. in computer science. In his opinion most research into so-called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – an intelligence system that is capable of solving generic problems such as optimizing itself, which lies at the heart of runaway AI capabilities – focuses on creating a simulation of a human brain.\n\nBrown uses the example of heavier-than-air flight: Birds are heavier than air, and birds fly, so it would make sense to assume that if you learn everything about birds, and you have the technological know-how to build a mechanical bird, doesn’t mean you’re going to achieve your goal of flight. People have been studying birds for centuries, but only after the invention of the internal combustion engine – something totally unrelated to birds – was heavier-than-air flight made possible.\n\n“It’s sort of a best-case worst-case estimate,” says Brown. “It’s worst-case because we ignore all other possible ways to get to AGI and instead focus on replicating an existing AGI system, the human brain. It’s best-case because we assume we understand the processes that need to be simulated in order to replicate the function of the brain, and we assume the current exponential rate of technological improvement of computing resources will hold over a rather long period of time.”\n\nWith this in mind, Brown thinks AGI is certainly possible, but he’s not convinced that AGI will inevitably lead to runaway AI and the singularity. “I think it massively overestimates the importance of intelligence in human progress and underestimates the dull, grueling work that is the science/technology feedback cycle,” says Brown.\n\nIn a paper presented at the 2012 Singularity Summit, researchers Dr. Stewart Armstrong and Kaj Satola from Oxford University’s Future of Humanity Institute studied the predictions of experts and non-experts and found strong evidence to suggest that predictions by both these groups are increasingly uncertain.\n\nSo how far are we from the singularity? No one really knows.\n\n*name changed",

    blurb:
      "Cape Town is a photographer’s dream, with countless photo opportunities. Here are some top spots where you can get a great shot.",
    body: "To say that Cape Town is a photographer’s dream is an understatement, especially if nature is where your lens points to most. It’s almost impossible to come to the city and not leave with at least a couple of great shots that will leave your friends back home turning green with envy. Here are some top spots where you can get a great shot.\n\nBloubergstrand\nA 20-minute drive from the city, this beach on the West Coast is where you’ll find the iconic postcard scene of Table Mountain, Devil’s Peak, and Lion’s Head looming over the city bowl. While you’re almost guaranteed a great shot any time of day, it’s during sunset that the magic happens, with the sky often lighting up in hues of purple, orange, red and yellow, adding a dramatic effect to an already incredible shot.\n\nLocal’s Tip:\n Just 5 minutes up the road from Blouberg, between Big Bay and Melkbosstrand, you’ll be able to see both Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles mountain range that stretches behind it. A truly magnificent scene.\n\nTop of Lion’s Head\nSpeaking of Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles – a quick hike up Lion’s Head will give you a 360-degree view of the CBD, the mountain,  the Atlantic Seaboard, and also Robben Island. This gives a bit of a different angle to Table Mountain, and you’ll be able to appreciate this 1,000-meter-high icon. Go at sunrise or sunset to get some incredible shots, and beat the crowds while you’re at it.\n\nLocal’s Tip:\n Hiking up Lion’s Head during a full moon is a very popular activity among the locals, especially in summer. This is a great opportunity to see the moon hanging over the city and lighting up Table Mountain in its glow.\n\nGroot Constantia\nThe Western Cape is world famous for its wines, and the Constantia Valley, a short drive from the CBD, is where it all began. These farms produce wine to this day, and the vineyard is a great place to take some spectacular pictures, especially during sunrise and sunset when the sun drops behind the mountains.\n\nLocal’s Tip:\n Winter is when the vines wear their full coat of green leaves, on a rainy day the dark clouds can add dramatic effect.\n\nKirstenbosch\nRight next to the Constantia Valley is the Kirstenbosch botanical gardens. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to an incredible variety of fauna and flora, pristine green lawns, and the back of Table Mountain looming behind it. The so-called ‘Golden Hour’ is when the magic happens, especially in the afternoon – just keep in mind the sun can set quite quickly behind the mountain.\n\nLocal’s Tip:\n The windy road that leads south towards Hout Bay serves as the entrance to a number of forests which are well worth a visit.\n\nSt. James Beach\nWhile Muizenberg is well known for its colorful bathing boxes and lazy longboard surfers, due to its popularity the beach can get very crowded, especially during summer. However, its smaller, more secluded neighbor, St James Beach, is as good a spot, if not better. It features the same colorful bathing boxes and a large tidal pool that makes for some interesting shots.\n\nLocal’s Tip:\n From July to November Southern Right and Humpback whales can be seen frolicking in Kalk Bay, often coming quite close to the shore, so while shooting in St. James, be sure to keep an eye out for some of these magnificent creatures who might be passing by.\n\nBo-Kaap\nThe Cape Malay neighborhood of Bo-Kaap is a favorite among photographers with its narrow, cobbled streets and brightly colored houses. The neighborhood has many nooks and crannies to explore, including some derelict buildings dotted along the streets.\n\nLocal’s Tip:\n On 2 January, Bo-Kaap comes alive during the Cape Minstrels’ famous festive walk through the streets of Cape Town. While the area gets very busy during the festivities, it’s worth a visit to see the streets of Bo-Kaap in all its festive glory.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "If some books and films are to be believed, inner peace and enlightenment are a mere exotic holiday away. But can you afford it?",
    body: "In a society obsessed with wellness and finding ourselves, we are led to believe that inner peace and enlightenment are a mere exotic holiday away… but only if you can afford it.\n\nSo goes the premise of Elizabeth Gilbert’s best-selling book, Eat, Pray, Love, where the author chronicles how she broke free from her unhappy life by traveling for a year, hanging out in exotic locations, and returning enlightened and complete.\n\nIt’s the kind of story that is supposed to empower women and encourage them to take control of their own lives, but somehow overlooks the fact that most just don’t have the financial means to do it, leaving the vast majority of women thinking that they’ll never feel enlightened or have inner peace.\n\nIt turns out that Eat, Pray, Love was more of a calculated business decision than a heartfelt journey of self-discovery. Hailed by Oprah as an important and smart way for people to invest in their well-being, Gilbert’s pilgrimage for enlightenment and the subsequent book came under heavy criticism when it was suggested that she funded her mind-altering meander through Italy, India, and Bali with a $200 000 advance after she pitched the idea for the book to her publisher. While there is no question that Gilbert benefitted (in more than just financial terms) from her experience, the problem is that this sort of adventure is unattainable to all but the most well-to-do.\n\nEat, Pray, Love is only one in a growing number of quasi-feminist writings known as ‘priv-lit’, a genre described by Joshua Sanders and Diana Barnes-Browne in their article Eat, Pray, Spend: Priv-Lit and the New Enlightened American Dream as “literature or media whose expressed goal is one of spiritual, existential, or philosophical enlightenment contingent upon women’s hard work, commitment, and patience, but whose actual barriers to entry are primarily financial.”\n\nAnother prime example of this is Under Tuscan Sun, Frances Mayes’ memoir of a post-divorce trip to the Italian countryside where she buys a dilapidated Tuscan villa on a whim and spends the following couple of months fixing it up in the hope that it will change her life.\n\nAs with Eat, Pray, Love the idea is great, but far removed from the average woman’s reality. Who can afford to buy a villa on a whim, fix it and then live on what seems like a permanent holiday for the next couple of months? Yet this is the kind of thing wellness champions like Oprah encourage – splurging on your well-being regardless of whether you can afford it or not.\n\nJust think of the financial burden that you will have to face upon your return from your enlightenment holiday – that alone will drive most people’s inner peace right out of them. By the time you’ve paid off your debt, you’ll be in need of another year of self-discovery, trapping you in a convenient cycle of spending and debt.\n\nThe main problem with priv-lit, argues Sanders and Barnes-Browne, is that it makes women believe that they are deeply flawed, as opposed to being “essentially worthy”. They say that instead of fantasizing about outrageously expensive paths of self-discovery, women should realize that there are more affordable, creative, and healthy ways to walk the path to reconnecting with their inner selves. When this happens, priv-lit can be put within the genre it belongs to fiction.",

    title: "Adult Attachment Theory: When is your love life formed?",
    blurb:
      "How you act in your romantic relationships is determined by your relationships as a child.",
    body: "Ever wondered how much your life as a kid influences you today? Well, it turns out that there’s a good chance that how you act in your romantic relationships as an adult is determined by the relationship you had with your primary caregiver as an infant. This is according to what is known in psychology as Adult Attachment Theory.\n\nAttachment theory mainly deals with the relationship between parents and children in developing how children respond in relationships and how they control their emotions. In the late ’80s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver noticed this trend (which is established within an infant’s first two years) extends into adulthood in certain ways. Children who see adults as a safe and secure base will likely have a similar experience with their own relationships as an adult.\n\nResearchers have identified four main attachment types or ‘styles’ in adults, one titled secure, and three types of insecure styles that include anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant.\n\nHere are each of these types explained. Which type do you fall into?\n\nSecure\nThis is the ideal attachment style. The person feels secure about themselves, as well as their relationship. These individuals manage to find a balance between independence and intimacy. It’s also the most common among adults. According to Shaver and Hazan, roughly 60 percent of people are securely attached.\n\nA securely-attached style results from a parent/infant relationship where the parent is balanced in their emotions, both positive and negative. These parents are emotionally available and respond appropriately to their child’s behavior.\n\nInsecure\nAnxious-PreoccupiedAs the name suggests, these are the worriers. They crave both physical and emotional intimacy to the point where they may become overly dependent (or clingy) on their partner. The anxiously attached also don’t rate themselves very highly and seek constant approval from their partners. People with this attachment style are usually emotionally expressive and impulsive in relationships. They constantly fear that others might not share the same emotional expression and that their partner will abandon them.\n\nThis attachment style usually develops due to mixed or inconsistent responses from parents, because the child never knows what to expect. Children of overprotective parents also tend to develop this style of attachment.\n\nDismissive-Avoidant\nThese people want independence and shy away from showing any emotion. They put everyone at arm’s length, avoid intimacy, and often don’t have high regard for their partner. These are typically the people who suppress and hide their feelings and usually distance themselves from people who reject them.\n\nDismissive-avoidant attachment styles usually develop when a child’s parent is disinterested and/or emotionally unavailable, forcing the child to expect rejection, hence keeping everyone at a safe distance to avoid getting hurt.\n\nFearful-avoidant\nOne of the most difficult styles and the antithesis of securely attached, people who are fearful-avoidant both crave intimacy, yet at the same time reject it. These people have negative views of both themselves and other people, they trust no one, not even themselves. It’s a rollercoaster ride where they try to suppress or reject their emotions, yet at the same time want to express them.\n\nThis confusing style usually develops as the result of a traumatic childhood, or where their emotional needs weren’t met.\n\nIt’s complicated…\nThese attachment styles are by no means absolute, with so many factors that may influence your attachment style along the way. These include multiple caregivers, for instance where one parent fosters a secure attachment and the other is insecure. Parents aren’t perfect either, and most parents don’t deliberately neglect their children.\n\nCloser to secure\nThankfully attachment styles aren’t permanent and can be improved. By partnering with someone who has a more secure attachment style, the insecure partner benefits from the more secure partner’s behavior. Choosing a more secure partner can be tricky though, as we often partner with those who affirm our view of relationships, such as an anxious style with a dismissive style, because the more intimacy the anxious partner wants, the more the dismissive partner pushes away, thereby creating the rejection that the person might expect.\n\nKnowing your attachment style makes you more aware of how you act and the areas you need to focus on to improve your style. Therapy, both couples, and individual, can help a great deal in understanding your type of attachment and provide tools to improve your attachment style.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "The Bewilderbeast is one of the most apt themes in recent years for what is arguably South Africa's most famous music festival.",
    body: "The Bewilderbeast – a reference to Badly Drawn Boy’s classic ‘The Hour of the Bewilderbeast’ album – is one of the aptest themes in recent years for what is arguably South Africa’s biggest and most famous music festival, Oppikoppi.\n\nThe festival has become an institution among music fans, with some traveling from as far as Europe and Australia to attend this uniquely South African experience. It’s dusty, it’s thorny, it’s hot, it’s cold, it’s sometimes wet, but it’s ALWAYS rock ‘n roll. Now in its 19th year, Oppikoppi has always been about the music and each year the line-up of bands keep getting stronger, drawing ever bigger crowds to the farm just outside Northam in Limpopo province.\n\n“The turning point for the festival was the year we booked Billy Talent – attendance exploded and it’s become bigger every year since,” says Misha Loots, one of the organizers of the annual event.\n\nWord-of-mouth has always been key to the festival’s growth, even in the early days. “Oppikoppi started as a private party, the next year we decided to bus in a couple of students from Tuks [University of Pretoria], and the word spread,” says legendary performer and South African music icon, Koos Kombuis.\n\nAnd spread it did – this year saw an estimated 20 000 eager music fans cram their tents onto the farm. However, the growth has not always been easy on the organizers, especially in terms of dealing with the near-stifling dust that the festival has become known for. It was especially bad at last year’s festival and efforts to manage it created more problems than it solved. But the Oppikoppi crew learned from their mistakes and this year saw a significant improvement – along with the rare appearance of some morning rain on Friday.\n\nAside from the dust, the cold, the thorns, the lost cellphones, the lost friends, and the cold showers – Oppikoppi still draws artists and fans to their thatch-covered stages like moths to a flame. Speaking to some of the artists, it becomes clear that it isn’t just another festival. “Other festivals are cool, but this is OPPIKOPPI! You HAVE to play at this festival! Playing on the James Philips main stage, there’s nothing like it,” says Fuzigish frontman, Jay Bones enthusiastically.\n\nHis sentiments are echoed by Black Cat Bones’ singer, Kobus de Kock Jr.: “Just to be part of it, no matter when you play or where you play, just to get to say that you’ve played Oppikoppi. It’s one of the top ten festivals you have to do.”\n\nThe stature of the festival also inspires artists to really put in an effort – it is these performances that draw the crowds – the anticipation that they will see bands give it their all.\n\n“...[Y]ou rehearse months in advance to make sure you have the best possible set for Oppikoppi,” says Andre Kriel from Black Cat Bones. It’s a relationship between artist and fan, with love spread both ways when it’s due.\n\nAnd at The Bewilderbeast, the artists definitely delivered; with local and international ‘koppi stalwarts and newcomers alike ripping up the six stages that are spread over the farm. Bands like Bittereinder, Jeremy Loops, Finley Quay, Shadow Club, Toya de Lazy, Mango Groove, Kidofdoom, Manchester Orchestra, and, of course, Deftones (to name a few)…played their hearts out to the eager crowds who lapped it up and responded with sweaty roars of love and adoration.\n\n“It’s not a trend, it’s a passion,” say Oppikoppi veterans, The Narrow. “It has to be passion if you come here and endure the dust and the sun...you’re still here for the music.” The annual pilgrimage to Oppikoppi by both bands and music fans serves as an affirmation that South Africa’s music Bewilderbeast is still rumbling loudly.\n\nSpeaking before an emotional last set at this year’s festival, Koos Kombuis summed it up: “If you look at the rest of the world and all their problems, you realize that we actually live in paradise.”\n\n",

      "Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood travelled to South Africa as the Global Ambassador for the Children's Radio Foundation.",
    body: "It’s not a new thing for artists to get involved in community upliftment projects, in fact, it’s almost become de rigueur for international artists to throw their weight behind some form of charity or the other. Africa especially has been a firm favorite among the tabloid-fronting crowd. Some artists, however, have a genuine empathy towards causes in the more underprivileged areas of the world, often being exposed to the plights of these communities through extensive touring or conversations with fellow artists.\n\nIt is one such conversation that led Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood to South Africa’s sunny shores, visiting various communities as the Global Ambassador for the Children’s Radio Foundation (CRF) – a UNICEF-supported project which aims to empower children from poorer communities by teaching them the fundamentals of broadcasting.\n\nArguably one of the most revered bands of their generation, Radiohead is known for both their fearless pursuit of progressing their sound and their innovative approach to an ever-changing industry, embracing change while being honest about the positive impact the old music industry model had on helping them get to where they are today. They’re also one of the more elusive bands in today’s age of information overload, with lead singer Thom Yorke known for his oft-snarky attitude toward the media. Greenwood, on the other hand, is a soft-spoken, approachable character: a stereotypical nice guy without the rock star ego one so often finds among successful musicians.\n\nEnding off his almost two-week visit to South Africa with a talk at the Red Bull Studios in Cape Town on 29 January, the bassist spoke passionately about CRF and the initiative’s role in making a sustainable difference in the five developing countries where the program is currently active. He also graciously answered questions from Radiohead fans who were almost foaming at the mouth just being in the mere presence of one of the founding members of their favorite band. He spoke about the similarities between the way the children who are part of the CRF project learn by trial-and-error and how this was how Radiohead initially found their feet as a band; how they figured things out as they went along, growing their sound and trying to stay true to themselves artistically. In the same vein, the township kids involved in the project are encouraged to contribute to their communities by staying true to the issues that affect them.\n\nGreenwood also spoke with much reverence of the people he had met on his journey to Africa, praising the CRF facilitators’ tenacity and passion for their jobs of guiding the children in producing work that they and their communities can be proud of. He seemed genuinely impressed by South Africa’s local music talent, even interrupting his chat to play a couple of tracks that had caught his attention.\n\nMany artists’ first visit to South Africa, and Cape Town in particular, usually involves a show and a holiday of some sort. Greenwood, however, decided to get his hands dirty on his first trip out and one senses his heartfelt passion for the CRF’s cause, that his trip was not some sort of publicity stunt and that Radiohead’s interests played second fiddle to him gaining an intimate understanding of the CRF’s functions.\n\nIt is the realization that radio still plays an important part in lesser developed communities that makes the CRF’s projects so special, that in an age where everyone has a voice online, even children without access to such technology are taught that they too have a voice, that their opinions matter and that it is up to them to instigate the change needed within their communities and ultimately in the greater world around them.\n\nGiven this, whether Radiohead will eventually tour South Africa seems irrelevant, what is important is that a foundation such as the Children’s Radio Foundation has found in one of the band’s founding members a passionate and inspired ambassador. That is enough.\n\nFor more information about the Children’s Radio Foundation and Colin Greenwood’s involvement, you can visit http://crf.waste.uk.com/\n\nThe article originally appeared on the now-defunct entertainmentafrica.com which was incorporated into iafrica.com\n\n\nPhoto credit: Red Bull Studios Cape Town ",

    title: "Can men really be feminists?",
    blurb:
      "Feminism is a hotly debated topic these days, but is the feminist movement an all-girls club, or are guys also invited?",
    body: "Just mentioning the word 'feminism' is enough to get any man rolling his eyes and going into defensive mode. It's a movement commonly perceived as being anti-male, and while there are some radical feminists who do support this view, it's not really what feminism is about or set out to achieve.\n\nThe focus of modern feminism is the promotion of women's rights in areas of politics, power, and sexuality and campaigning for gender equality in these fields, as well as in society as a whole. This focus has been maintained since the dawn of modern feminism, with each of the three 'waves' of feminism emphasizing different areas within the movement.\n\nFirst 'wave' of modern feminism in the late 1800s and early 1900s primarily campaigned for equality in politics, particularly women's rights to suffrage – the right to vote and run for public office. During the second 'wave' in the 1960s, the focus shifted towards social and cultural equality, especially in areas of sexual liberation and workplace discrimination. The third and most recent 'wave' took shape in the 1990s as a continuation of the second wave and in reaction to the perceived failures of the second wave, focussing on women's sexual empowerment and society's view of femininity. This wave also includes an internal debate on what role societal conditioning has played in gender differences and feminist support for the men's liberation movement.\n\nHowever, as Theodore Roosevelt famously said, 'Every reform movement has a lunatic fringe', feminism has its fair share of radicals who aid in perpetuating the stereotype of feminism as a malebashing movement filled with bitter activists intent on beating down societal gender inequalities with the poor suffering female stick. Myths such as gross income inequality, educational discrimination, and feminism's advocating for gender role equality largely stem from extremists' views of the movement.\n\nSadly, while women's rights have made a lot of progress in the developed world, successfully shrinking the gender gap, in Africa vast inequalities still exist, especially in more traditional communities where the man is still in charge and women are treated as second-class citizens. Even in South Africa where we're standing with one foot in the developed world and the other in the developing world, a disparity between the genders still exists. While we've come a long way, archaic workplace policies and perceptions regarding such things as part-)me and flexi-time work, family responsibility and a woman's ability to handle stress in the workplace are still fairly common.\n\nDiscrimination in the education system is also a problem. Poorer families who can only afford to send one child to school will then send a boy instead of a girl. But perhaps of the biggest concern for women's rights in South Africa is domes)c violence and rape. According to a recent survey conducted by the University of Cape Town and Johns Hopkins University, domestic violence and rape is the most common form of violence that causes severe and long-term post-trauma)c stress disorder among women in South Africa. In addition, instances of depression, anxiety, suicide, substance abuse, repeated victimization, disability, HIV infection and chronic physical health problems are also likely to increase due to rape or domes)c violence. Considering this, it is very easy for the feminist movement in South Africa to slot into the stereotype of man-hating.\n\nHowever, women's rights advocates such as feministssa.com seem to focus on what feminism set out to do in the first place. They are more focused on creating awareness of the need for increased Government spending on prevention and supportive care for victims of domestic violence and rape, than they are on painting men as evil, unwanted elements of society. To many men, the idea of feminism is a tough pill to swallow, because it sheds light on how badly we have and continue to treat our women. It then begs the question of why men get so defensive when they are confronted with feminism, instead of supporting the cause and throwing their weight behind gender transformation.\n\n",

      "People love to complain about social media, but is it social media or is it really the people who complain that have the problem?",
    body: "I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of times I’ve heard people say they hate Facebook and they’re going to delete their accounts, but is it Facebook or is it the people who complain that have the problem?\n\nStatements like those are often preceded by some kind of major life event; a bad break-up, trouble at work, the passing of a loved one, or something like that. We become disillusioned and overwhelmed, and it’s natural to take a step back to assess our lives. When in this state, people often put the blame on social media and decide to unplug, but as Maureen O’Connor from New York Magazine asks, do you hate social media or do you hate what and who it reminds you of?\n\nIt’s worth acknowledging that while the internet and subsequent social media have become a part of the fabric of our lives, it only offers a tiny glimpse into the lives of others. The truth is that we show only a small part of what we’re up to in our daily lives – most often the parts that are fun or worth bragging about. This “curated” version has little context and can often suggest that others lead perfect, happy lives compared to our own messy, complex ones.\n\nBut the reality is that just because a couple always posts pictures of themselves in loving embraces, doesn’t mean they don’t ever fight, and just because someone’s status updates are always about how much fun they’re having socializing, doesn’t mean they’re never bored at home on a Friday night. The feeling of missing out or jealousy is understandable until you realize that the “perfect” lives people portray on their social media accounts aren’t possible.\n\nWe use social media to validate our points of view, even those that stem from insecurity. But instead of giving us perspective, this just sends us deeper into our naval-gazing introspection. I recently ran into an ex who said some pretty nasty and hurtful things to me when we broke up. The encounter left my self-image a little dented, so I hopped onto Facebook and posted a couple of inspirational quotes and a sad song from a band I liked, and started counting the likes to get some artificial affirmation of my self-worth. But this only works until you see a picture of your ex frolicking about on a beach with her new boyfriend. I hate my life, I will end up alone one day, and Facebook sucks.\n\nThe bottom line is that we should be using social media as a tool rather than a vital lifeline to our relationships with other people. Giving the posts you see on Facebook or any other social network too much weight and meaning will only set you up for disappointment.\n\nYou have a significant degree of control over what you see on any social media platform. If you don’t want to see your ex having fun without you, then unfriend, unfollow, block, and report it as spam. No one is forcing you to stay connected to people who make you miserable. It’s like driving slowly and deliberately past an accident scene and complaining about how you hate seeing blood. It’s simple, just don’t look.\n\nUnplugging from our overly social internet experiences has its place, and going offline is the same as spending a week on the beach after a long and stressful year. The internet and social media have become part of our lives, and it’s something you have to accept, but how much you interact with it is up to you. At the end of the day, it’s only a medium that you use to communicate with other people, and unplugging after a break-up will help, but it won’t take the heartache away. Unplugging is a great opportunity to work on making real, meaningful connections with people daily. Investing in real friendships – outside of the social media sphere – is a vital part of our lives that we often compromise in favor of sitting zombie-like at our computers, selecting the “like” icon for someone else’s carefully filtered Instagram photo.\n\nThere’s a duality in Facebook, we have to keep reminding ourselves that it only shows a part of our lives, but it doesn’t define us as a person. It’s a great way to stay in touch with people, but physical interaction still trumps any contact online, and we need to find a balance.\n\nIf you need to get away from people, do so. Unplug, go sit on a beach, and recharge, but don’t blame Facebook.\n\n",

      "A comic book cover of Spider-Woman sparked a furore in the media around the sexualisation of women in comic books.",
    body: "A recent comic book cover of Spider-Woman in a ready-to-pounce crouch sparked a furor in mainstream media around the sexualization of women in comic books. Was this simply an uninformed, knee-jerk reaction or does the argument add value to the equality debate?\n\nThe comic book industry has a long history of portraying women as supporting characters and throwaway storylines. Female characters were written in a manner to conform to gender roles and stereotypes of the respective time, and a shift away from this frankly sexist portrayal in favor of a more equal one slowly started happening towards the end of the 20th Century. As the equality movement started gaining real momentum over the last couple of years, comic book publishers started warming up to the idea of introducing female superheroes with more in-depth storylines into the comic book realm.\n\nThen in August this year, Marvel proudly announced the cover of its first dedicated series of Spider-Woman comics, complete with an alternative cover by veteran cartoonist Milo Manara. It was supposed to be great news for female superheroes because very few have had their own series in the traditionally male-dominated comic book superhero arena. Instead, all hell broke loose with many arguing that she was yet another female character being sexualized.\n\nMarvel was slammed by everyone from Elle Magazine to The Guardian and even Time magazine for the supposedly sexist representation of Spider-Woman as she crouched on the ledge of a building she had just scaled.\n\nMegan Friedman from Elle drew first blood, accusing the cover design of being almost pornographic, adding that if Spider-Man was drawn in this manner the concept would never fly. Elianna Dockterman from Time weighed in by saying the cover took the “sex factor” to a new extreme, and that men would never be placed in such a compromising position.\n\nThe backlash to their criticism began with internet humourist Maddox calling the critics out on their ignorance of comics in a video. This cites countless examples of male superheroes, predominantly Spider-Man himself, in equally “compromising” positions.\n\nBut why the ruckus over comic books? The attention from the mainstream media is quite baffling and it’s difficult to figure out why comic books have suddenly become a hot topic of conversation in publications whose readers are more than likely not comic book readers. What are they trying to achieve in the name of equality? Perhaps it’s the fact that nearly half of comic book readers are female and it’s their welfare that concerns these critics so much, or maybe it’s because young boys (and girls) are supposedly being fed the wrong message about what women’s bodies are supposed to look like.\n\nIn his video, Maddox points to the hypocrisy of the very magazines which in turn drive sales on the back of unrealistic-looking women in compromising, over-sexualized positions.\n\nIn an LA Times column entitled The great Spider-Woman sexist derriere debate, blogger Charlotte Allen points to the harmful impact on feminism that uninformed criticism such as that by Elle and Times can have on the fight for equality.\n\nThere’s no denying that sexism in comic books still exists and is something that needs to be addressed, particularly as comic books start entering the mainstream via numerous successful Hollywood blockbuster films. However, while this controversy over Spider-Woman’s sleek derriere has sparked a renewed debate around the issue, coming out guns blazing is the wrong way to go about things. It puts the equality movement in a bad light and paints its proponents as ignorant alarmists. Instead, the focus should be on changing the perceptions from within the community (and not just comic books), as artist and writer Kelly Sue DeConnick has been doing with great success through her own well-placed and constructive criticism of the comic book industry.\n\nThe wave of the equality revolution is definitely taking us in the right direction, but we need to be careful not to lose focus.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "Being alone is one of society's great anxieties. But why is it that everyone is so scared to be alone with their own thoughts?",
    body: "Being alone is one of society’s great anxieties. The idea of solitude scares us so much that people would rather give themselves an electric shock than be alone with their own thoughts. But why is it that everyone is so scared of solitude?\n\nA big part of this fear of being alone is the confusion that exists between loneliness and solitude. We seem to think that they’re one and the same thing, but as existentialist philosopher Paul Tillich put it so eloquently, “Language … has created the word ‘loneliness’ to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word ‘solitude’ to express the glory of being alone.”\n\nThrough the ages, many great thinkers and artists from Aristotle to Schopenhauer, Einstein to Hemmingway, and actors like Audrey Hepburn have celebrated the power of spending time alone. It is said that solitude fosters creativity because it helps us to make sense of the crazy world we live in by giving the mind a chance to connect the dots of abstract and seemingly disparate thoughts.\n\nBut it’s not just our creativity that benefits from solitude, but also personal growth. Most of my travels I have done alone, the weeks spent traveling on a bus by myself, walking around foreign cities with just my own thoughts have taught me a lot about myself.\n\nAside from loneliness, perhaps the greatest fear people have of spending time on their own is that we are scared of what lurks inside our minds, those dark little corners that we conveniently ignore by filling our lives with constant noise. We don’t allow ourselves to stop to mull over our issues, think them through, and deal with them, or at least attempt to. As a result psychologists’ rooms are brimming with people who are afraid to face their inner demons but are forced to do it anyway by these professionals from whom they seek help and guidance, by turning their gaze inward.\n\nWe’ve become addicted to this noise, and it’s a fallacy that we have to be connected and in touch all the time, that the choice to disengage is one antisocial step closer to becoming a hermit. However, as Maria Popova points out in her essay on the power of being alone, solitude doesn’t make us more antisocial, it actually enables us to connect better with others. She argues that by becoming more comfortable with whom we are deep down inside, we free up some of our capacity to let others in. Through all the noise we seem to miss the freedom that comes with solitude.\n\nDespite all the benefits solitude brings, we still view it with a level of disdain and label those who choose to be alone with pity and often label them either crazy or sociopaths, or both. It’s like the idea that some people choose to be alone is somehow unfathomable to society at large. According to author Sarah Maitland, we fear those who are different, people who make choices that don’t conform to societal norms, and claims that many of society’s problems, including its attitude towards solitude, are based on paradoxical paradigms. On the one hand, society praises extroverted groupthink, yet at the same time, people admire intellectuals, artists, and adventurers who spend most of their time and create some of their greatest work, in solitude. We've sent these mixed messages about being alone and it adds to the confusion, which further strengthens fear, says Maitland.\n\nI am in my mid-30s and I’m alone. It’s not because I can’t get a girlfriend, but because I choose to be; it’s what I need in my life right now. Sure I’m lonely sometimes, but so are people in relationships. I won’t be alone forever, we are social beings after all, but for now, I embrace “the glory of being alone,” and it’s awesome.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "Are emotionally intense people misunderstood, or are they simply emotionally immature?",
    body: "Are emotionally intense people misunderstood, or simply emotionally immature? I investigate society’s view of emotional intensity and why intense people deserve a break.\n\n“You are too intense,” is a phrase most emotionally intense people are tired of hearing. It’s like telling someone their voice is too deep, or their eyes are too blue because emotional intensity can’t be switched off, it’s simply the way some people are. Yet it is something that is often misunderstood by a society ill-equipped to deal with people who are so deeply in touch with their emotions, by calling them emotionally immature.\n\nOn the contrary, these people experience life on a very intense, full-on emotional level, a maturity that those who are perhaps not as in tune with their feelings often find difficult to deal with, because they find it overwhelming. For the emotionally intense person, it is simply normal and they often don’t perceive how different their experience of life is from that of other people.\n\nIn a piece investigating why emotionally intense people are prone to have troubling issues in relationships, educator Ariane Benefit writes that our culture treats emotional intensity with a level of disdain, often putting it in the mental illness box, seeing it as a defect in character and denying the validity of such a person’s reality. This failure to recognize the variation in intensity leads these individuals to try to suppress their intensity, rather than learn how to cope with it.\n\nPart of the problem may be that emotional well-being is often overlooked in our education system, and children aren’t brought up learning how to deal with various levels of intensity and that it’s okay to be more or less intense, leaving the more emotionally intense children feeling misunderstood and pressured to be “normal”.\n\nAs adults in the workplace, this perpetuates, and Benefit uses Steve Jobs's reputation as an “obnoxious egomaniac” as a case in point – even when his emotional intensity was key to him becoming the iconic innovator that he was, challenging the status quo and refusing to have his visionary ideas watered down by the popular thinking. Yes, Jobs was considered a genius, but there’s long been a strong correlation between giftedness and emotional intensity, one of the five areas of intensity identified by influential psychologist Kazimierz Dabrowski in gifted individuals.\n\nIt’s paradoxical, argues Benefit, that it is desirable today to be unemotional, unaffected, self-controlled, to appear centered and not challenge anyone, yet expected to be passionate about something. One can’t be passionate without being emotional. And therein lies the crux of the problem according to Benefit.\n\n“When did having and showing deep emotions become a fatal flaw?” she asks.\n\nWe live in a culture that celebrates the common denominator – the average – and those on the extremities are treated with caution and fear and forced to conform, to dumb down, to become less intense, to forgo part of who they are in order to be like everyone else. This can have a stifling effect on the valuable contribution these individuals can make to society. However, the fact remains that emotionally intense people are in the minority, and a level of conformity is needed to be able to function in society.\n\nIn her article, Benefit states that her plea for the emotionally intense isn’t intended to excuse bad behavior and poor social skills, but rather to encourage more productive – and creative – ways of dealing with our differences through awareness and understanding.\n\n",

      "Achieving our financial goals requires proper planning, and the first step towards financial freedom is saving.",
    body: "We all dream of being financially independent, retiring comfortably, providing for all our family’s wants and needs, and even spoiling ourselves from time to time. Achieving these goals requires proper financial planning, and the first step is saving.\n\nMost of us don’t save enough to be able to achieve our financial goals, but by following some of the basic investment principles you can get your savings to plan on track.\n\nThe first thing to remember is that there is no quick way to riches. The most stable and profitable investments take time to grow, and if someone offers you incredible returns that sound too good to be true, then it probably is and you should avoid these schemes. Rather invest with a company that is well-known in the financial services industry with a good track record.\n\nInvestment and time go hand in hand, as it determines the risk of the investment. The longer you invest, the more risk you can take, and the more compound interest will work in your favor. Have an investment time frame in mind, but try to keep your investment in the market for as long as you can. This is why experts advise people to start saving as early as possible.\n\nKeep investing regularly, even if the market is going through a slump. The habit of saving is an important one, and by continuing the habit through tough economical times, you will reap the benefits when the market recovers.\n\nDon’t keep all your eggs in one basket, spread your investment over different products that offer different levels of risk and returns. Spreading your investment risk over a number of products can help you through the tougher financial times, as one investment might gain when another is going through a slump.\n\nWith the immense multitude of investment products available, choosing a portfolio that will suit your individual needs can be daunting. Use the services of a professional portfolio manager or financial advisor to assist you – their intimate knowledge of the investment landscape will be to your benefit. These professionals also regularly review your investment strategy to ensure it’s on the right path toward achieving your financial goals.\n\nUltimately it’s important to remember that your financial needs are unique, and just because a certain investment works for a friend, doesn’t mean it will be ideal for you.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "An Independent Financial Adviser can guide investors through the often-tricky investment landscape.",
    body: "The investment world can be tricky to navigate, and most people simply don’t have the time, knowledge, or experience to invest successfully. An Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) can guide investors to help them avoid difficulties they might encounter.\n\nInstead of just picking products, these advisers look at your unique circumstances and help you make decisions that are right for your particular needs while helping you to steer clear of the potential pitfalls of investing by yourself.\n\nHere are a number of mistakes investors typically make:\n\nNo investment plan\nAs with any big life decision, it’s important to have a plan. If you don’t have a goal, you won’t know what you’re working towards. Having something to work towards is important to know what road you need to take to get there. An IFA will help you with this plan, along with plotting out a map of how to reach it.\n\nChoosing the wrong investment product\nThe number of funds and investment products is overwhelming. To make things more complicated, every product has a different tax structure and the funds all have different goals. An adviser can help you make a selection to suit your particular needs.\n\nForgetting about inflation\nAs time goes by, the value of money decreases. You can buy much less with R100 in 2014 than you could in 1990. That’s called inflation, and it applies to investments too. An adviser can help you keep the value of your investment by investing in products and funds with high enough returns to compensate for inflation over the period of your investment.\n\nCashing out your retirement savings when switching jobs\nSpending their retirement savings when changing jobs or getting retrenched is a common mistake people make because it’s very tempting to use a large amount of money. It’s very important that you don’t touch this money and preserve it, else you will not have enough money to live on by the time you want to retire. An IFA will give you to keep your hands off this money.\n\nConcentrating on only one market or asset class\nIt’s important not to have all your investment eggs in one basket. An adviser will help you diversify your investment by spreading it over a number of different products or funds that will lower your risk and help your savings grow.\n\nLetting emotions get in the way\nWhen it comes to investing, letting your emotions guide you is never a good idea. Investors who act on emotions are known to have bad timing with the market, and they also tend to destroy the value of their investments by switching funds too often. An adviser can help you avoid this hazard.\n\nThings to keep in mind when choosing an IFA:\nChoosing an adviser is not a choice that should be taken lightly, because they will be advising you on very important decisions in your life.\n\nTo find an IFA, you can ask for a recommendation from someone you trust, get in touch with the Financial Planning Institute of Southern Africa (FPI) or look at companies that provide details of IFAs on their websites.\n\nThere are a couple of things you need to consider:\n\nTrust\nIt’s important to know that your chosen adviser is honest, has your best interest at heart, and values your business.\n\nQualifications and credentials\nThe law requires all financial advisers to be licensed by the Financial Services Board (FSB)\n\nIndependence\nIt’s important for an IFA to be independent because it means they’re not incentivized to advise on certain products over others.\n\nFees\nBefore you choose an IFA, make sure you know their fee structure, and know what you are going to be charged for. It’s important that the adviser explains his fees and how they work to you upfront.\n\nInvesting can be scary because markets fluctuate and it’s easy to fear that you will lose all your money. An adviser will hold your hand through this and help calm your nerves. They’re the voice of reason that will keep you from making rash decisions. An adviser will also ensure that a disciplined savings and investment process is in place and maintained, giving your investment valuable time in the market.\n\n\nThis article was part of a content marketing campaign for a major financial services provider.",

      "Multivitamins are supposed to give our bodies a boost. But are they really that helpful in keeping us healthy?",
    body: "Multivitamins are supposed to give our immune systems a boost and top up the vitamins our modern diets don’t provide, but scientists believe we’re wasting our time – and money – slugging them down.\n\nIn South Africa, the vitamin and dietary supplement industry are worth an estimated R1 billion, up by a staggering 84 percent since 2005*. But are multivitamins really that helpful in keeping us healthy?\n\nRecently Emily Oster, a professor in economics at the University of Chicago recently reviewed a number of studies and found that there is no evidence that multivitamins actually help improve our health, and that scientists can’t isolate the effects of vitamins from other factors, such as generally healthy diets and regular exercise.\n\nShe specifically looked at the effect that taking extra Vitamins C, D, and E has on our health. This magic trio of vitamins has been linked to everything from lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, weight gain, and multiple sclerosis, to fewer mood disorders and lower mortality rates. However, Oster points out that the studies claiming these benefits were largely observational studies that didn’t factor in other variables such as age and overall lifestyle, and randomized follow-up studies showed none of the claimed benefits.\n\nIt doesn’t end there, a recent article in New York Magazine cites a study that revealed people who take daily multivitamins believe they’re doing their health such favor that they can go out and partake in activities that are actually potentially more harmful to their health, such as heavy drinking.\n\nPsychologist Wray Hubert calls this “moral licensing” and compares it to the counter-productive sense of justification for a bad diet choice they make after they’ve exercised.\n\nAll of this doesn’t take away from the fact that there are serious vitamin deficiencies such as scurvy and rickets that can cause serious problems. But these are extremes and you’re highly unlikely to get this level of deficiency if you live in a developed country and have access to a range of foods. So, unless you’ve been told by your doctor to take vitamins, you can probably ditch your daily dose.\n\n*Based on 2005 figures with conservative forecasted growth taken into account.\n\n\nThis article was featured on iafrica.com",

      "We live incredibly stressful lives and it's not easy to get away from it, but there are some things you can do to reduce stress.",
    body: "We live incredibly stressful lives, juggling family, career, and other responsibilities. All the stress is getting to us, and studies have shown that if left unchecked, stress can lead to high blood pressure, anxiety, depression, and even heart attacks. It's not easy to get away from stress, but there are some things you can do to actively reduce stress.\n\nWhile all the running around at the office can increase your stress levels, running around outside the office can greatly reduce them. Besides being great for staying in shape, exercise boosts your body's endorphin production, decreasing your body's hormones. You don't have to get an hour or two every day either, only 20 minutes of exercise a couple of days a week is enough to become more stress-free.\n\nAfter you've hit the gym or run around the block, you're going to be hungry. Eating a healthy diet will not only provide your body with the right kind of fuel for your next appointment with your personal trainer, but it's also great at reducing your stress levels. Junk food and refined sugars can spike your energy, but ultimately leave you feeling sluggish. A healthy diet low in sugar and filled with fresh fruit and vegetables will help keep you alert and reduce your stress.\n\nThey say rest is the most overlooked part of an exercise routine, and our stress levels often increase when we're tired. A good night's sleep is essential for recharging your batteries and preparing you for the next busy day, enabling you to better cope with the pressure at the office. Most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep per night, so after your healthy dinner, grab a book and hit the hay early for a change.\n\nIf you really struggle to relax, perhaps it's time you take a break and get away from it all for a bit. Nothing helps you to recharge better than disconnecting from the rat race for a couple of days. When you feel your stress levels rising and your weekends filled with social activities, take a couple of days' leave and get out of town for a bit, ideally where there is no cell reception. Switch off your phone, put away the tablet, and let your computer 'sleep' a little bit longer. They'll still be there when you get back, and you'll feel revived and strong to pack your busy schedule by the horns.\n\nOne of the best ways to reduce stress is to breathe. It sounds so simple, but deep breathing is very effective at reducing stress because it makes your body feel like it does when you're relaxed. Think about your breathing when you're sleeping. Deep breathing boosts oxygen levels and has been shown to lower blood pressure. Give yourself ten minutes a day where you switch off and sit quietly by yourself and focus on your breathing. The positive effect it will have on your stress levels is amazing.\n\n\nThis article was part of a content marketing campaign for a major financial services provider.",

      "The fight against HIV/AIDS continues with antiretroviral drugs proving to be an effective treatment, but also in HIV prevention.",
    body: "The fight against HIV/AIDS continues with antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs proving to be an effective treatment, extending the lives of those living with the disease. However, HIV/Aids is still taking a huge toll globally and in South Africa.\n\nThankfully scientists are not only making progress in treatment, but also in HIV prevention. Recent studies have shown that a new treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is able to significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection, especially among high-risk groups, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men and women.\n\nWhat is PrEP?\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a treatment that consists of taking a combination of antiretroviral medications, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (known commonly as Truvada), on a daily basis to prevent or significantly lower the risk of HIV infection.\n\nWho should use PrEP?\nPrEP should only be considered as a preventative option by those who are HIV-negative and at risk of exposure to the virus. “This includes key population people such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, but it also includes heterosexual men and women who are in discordant relationships (that is, where one partner is HIV-positive and the other negative),” says Dr. Kevin Rebe, special medical consultant to Anova Health Institute’s Health4Men initiative.\n\nWho should not use PrEP?\nConsidering the preventative purpose of PrEP, people who are already HIV-positive or those who might be in the window period for infection should not use PrEP.\n\nThe treatment can potentially be harsh on kidney function too, and thus it is not recommended for those who have pre-existing kidney function problems.\n\nPregnant and breastfeeding women have been excluded from PrEP trials thus far, so there is no verifiable data for its use in this group. This includes injection drug users too.\n\nImportant things to know about PrEP\nArguably the most important thing to remember about PrEP is that while it is effective and safe and can significantly lower the risk of HIV infection, it doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To get the best level of protection, PrEP should always be used together with other preventative measures such as condoms. Regular HIV testing is also key.\n\nPrEP is only effective if the medication gets taken every day and, as with many drugs, it takes time to become effective – that is, between seven and 20 days, says Dr. Rebe.\n\nThe research\nThere have been a number of studies around the efficacy of PrEP, with nearly 40 medical journals publishing findings on 18 PrEP clinical trials, says Dr. Rebe. “The key studies in this ongoing research are iPrEX, iPrEX OLE, PROUD, and IPERGAY for men who have sex with men, and TDF2 and Partners PrEP for women,” he says.\n\nHowever, the results of some of these studies aren’t ideal, especially those aimed at women, he adds. “The problem is that studies on PrEP in women have been confusing. While TDF2 and Partners PrEP showed good effectiveness of PrEP, two other studies, FEM PrEP and VOICE, did not show the effectiveness of PrEP.  This was because the women in the studies didn’t take their pills, and PrEP only works if it’s taken regularly.”\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on health and beauty retailer, Clicks’s website.\n\n",

      "As a contributor to a healthy , well-balanced diet, tomatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids and dietary fibres.",
    body: "Tomatoes are everywhere, from salads to pizzas, to stews, to sauces, to pasta.\n\nThey’re also one of the most important non-starchy vegetables in our diet, grown by many subsistence and resource-poor farmers to supplement many South Africans’ staple diet of maize meal-based foods, says Prof Dharini Siyakumar, Associate Professor at Tshwane University of Technology’s Department of Crop Science.\n\nAs a contributor to a healthy, well-balanced diet, our little juicy red friends are rich in vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, and dietary fibers. They’re also an important source of antioxidants, in particular lycopene.\n\nLycopene is what gives tomatoes their red color and unlike most nutrients in fresh fruits and veggies, it has a greater bioavailability after processing and cooking, meaning that you get the benefits, whether it’s simmering in your Bolognese or squeezed over your boerie roll.\n\nOver the years, through a number of studies, it was found that the consumption of tomatoes can be linked to lowering the risk of heart disease, cholesterol, and even bone disease such as osteoporosis. However, the heavyweight in the ring of research into the benefits of tomatoes in our diets is the fight against cancer.\n\nIn a study published in the British Journal of Medicine, researchers at the University of Portsmouth’s School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences found that lycopene – present in all red fruits and vegetables, but with the highest concentration in tomatoes – intercepts the ability of cancer to make the connections that enables it to attach itself to the healthy blood supply of the body.\n\nCancer cell growth is triggered when a process is initiated through the release of certain chemicals that links cancer cells with the healthy gatekeeper cells lining blood vessels (endothelial cells), thereby enabling the cancer cells to attach to the body’s blood supply. Laboratory experiments showed that lycopene disrupted this critical linking process, preventing cancer cells from growing.\n\nDirector of the research Dr. Mridula Chopra said: “This simple chemical reaction was shown to occur at lycopene concentrations that can easily be achieved by eating processed tomatoes.”\n\nWhile all cancer cells use the same mechanism to tap into a healthy blood supply, the effect of this mechanism was emphasized by the researchers due to lycopene’s tendency to accumulate in prostate tissues.\n\n“The important thing is for sufficient lycopene to reach where it can matter. We know that in the case of prostate tissues it gets there,” said Dr. Chopra.\n\nHowever, she is quick to point out the limitations of their research: “I stress that our tests were done in test tubes in a laboratory and more testing needs to be carried out to confirm our findings, but the laboratory evidence we have found is clear – it is possible to intercept the simple mechanism some cancer cells use to grow at concentrations that can be achieved by eating sufficient cooked tomatoes.”\n\nThe research done by Dr. Chopra and her team is far from conclusively proving that lycopene has an effect against cancer, primarily due to the lack of long-term research, as in the case of the health benefits of olive oil, but scientists agree that research such as this aids in the understanding of how lycopene affects the formation of blood vessels.\n\nDespite the storm surrounding tomatoes’ alleged superpower, everyone agrees that adding more tomatoes to our diets can only be beneficial in contributing to our overall well-being. This means you can literally chop, dice, slice, squeeze and peel to your heart’s content.\n\n",

      "Drones have gone from mere toys to an indispensable tool for film makers, opening up possibilities not previously available.",
    body: "Drones have gone from mere toys to indispensable tools for filmmakers, and have had an immense impact on the industry, opening up possibilities not previously available.\n\nDrones are remote-controlled aircraft that can be operated autonomously. They have proven to be very successful in military operations with the ability to perform dangerous operations without risking the lives of human pilots. However, drones have also had a major impact on the film industry. Their relatively low cost, small size, and maneuverability have changed the way films are made, even big-budget films like the recent Marvel blockbuster ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’.\n\nAccording to 10-year film industry veteran Andrew Pollock, who has worked on numerous commercials, film, and television productions, the popularity of drones has had two major effects on the film industry:\n\n“[Drones] has lowered the cost of shooting aerial footage significantly making it affordable to productions with much smaller budgets [and] they also make it possible to get shots that were previously impossible to get,” Pollock told me recently via email. “For me, it's changed how I do things quite dramatically since shooting aerials is pretty much all I do now.”\n\nThis is especially true for sports filmmakers who are constantly looking for interesting angles, and for whom it is often a labor of love.\n\nPollock points out that camera technology has also been instrumental in the success of these little remote-controlled flyers. Over the years cameras have become small enough for small drones to carry. Camera manufacturers have taken notice of the popularity and potential that drones hold and major camera manufacturers like Arri have released smaller cameras that can be used in drones more easily.\n\nBefore modern drones like the so-called ‘multirotor’ or multicopter’ (drones with more than one rotor) arrived on the scene, remote-controlled helicopters were used, but these posed a number of risks. First of all, they’re tricky to fly, and learning to fly one properly can take hours of practice. Then there’s the safety aspect, and Pollock tells of a radio-controlled helicopter pilot who was decapitated in New York a number of years ago when he lost control of the craft. Multirotor drones are not only safer due to the smaller blades, but they’re also more reliable and some have what Pollock calls redundancy features, meaning that a drone with more than six rotors will still be able to operate if one of the rotors fails.\n\nDespite the popularity of drones and the advantages, they have for filmmaking, Pollock believes they won’t completely replace helicopters. He says that helicopters can fly much higher, faster, and farther than drones at this stage, and they’re able to carry more complicated camera setups often used in high-budget productions.\n\nAs civilian use of drones increases, safety and privacy concerns are moving governments to try and regulate this relatively new space, and Pollock says that some countries are already close to introducing legislation that requires professional operators to undergo training and receive certification for drones.\n\nWhile there is tremendous scope for drones outside of the film industry, within the entertainment industry these little flying machines have already made their mark in everything from sports, nature, tourism, and even (somewhat bizarrely) soft-core porn.\n\n",

    body: "As far as wearable technology goes, smart fabrics embody the concept like a few others. However, as woven wires and sensors, the fashionable tech poses a major problem: they cannot be washed, until now…\n\nWith a long and rich history, smart fabrics made their way into wearables at the turn of the 19th century when electricity became more widespread. Engineers and designers started to experiment with the combination of electricity and clothing, and in 1884 the New York Times made mention of ballet girls wearing electric lights on their outfits powered by batteries concealed in special pockets. Back then it was more about fashion and novelty than practical uses.\n\nIt was the space race in the ‘50s and ‘60s, the invention of a way to integrate fiber optics into fabrics in the late ‘90s, and recent advances in nanotechnology that have brought the immense potential that these fabrics hold within our grasp, and thanks to organic electronics, the fabrics of the future will smell as promising as the potential they place.\n\nOrganic electronics is a specialized scientific field that looks specifically at organic molecules or polymers with regard to their electronic properties such as conductivity. Materials currently used in creating smart fabrics include a dirty half-dozen of complex materials. Among these are conductive fibers, treated conductive fibers, conductive fabrics, an array of conductive materials as sensors, conductive inks, and planar fashionable circuit boards. All of these contain some sort of metal component to serve as a conductor for electronic signals, which can be destroyed by the water and friction from washing.\n\nRecent research has shown that such conductive polymers are not only biocompatible (meaning they’re not harmful to living tissue), but they can also be made biodegradable; and in experiments with a polymer known as PEDOT: PSS, can also withstand the strain a wash cycle puts on the fibers without losing much of its electronic properties.\n\nThis is great news for industries looking to incorporate electronic textiles. Already there are a number of potential uses, the most intriguing and promising of which lie in the medical and military realm. Features in the medical field could include the ability to monitor patients and administer treatments remotely, while the military could decrease a soldier’s load by integrating elements like GPS tracking, temperature control, and fatigue monitoring into the fabric.\n\n",

    title: "The importance of leadership in business",
    blurb:
      "Strong leadership is critical to the success of a business, but not every leader can lead. Why is leadership so important?",
    body: "Strong leadership is critical to the success of a business. Without a good leader, a business can never achieve its full potential. But not every leader can lead. Great leaders use appropriate business styles to influence stakeholders at all levels of business, both internally and externally, This can have an enormously positive impact on the business. But why is leadership so important?\n\n1. Establish a vision\nOne of the most important roles of leadership is to create the company’s vision. What does the business stand for and what is it working towards? This is critical to the success and growth of a business. The best leaders are those who live the vision of the company every day, giving them the ability to turn good companies into great companies. \n\n2. Leaders introduce change\nBusiness environments are always changing and if businesses don’t change with it, they run the risk of falling behind and becoming irrelevant. Management must constantly adjust the business strategy to stay in tune with the market or choose a different direction to pursue other opportunities. It is up to business leaders to communicate and implement these changes, why they are implemented, and what they will mean for the business. Great leaders inspire others to embrace change and work towards achieving the company’s goals.\n\n3. Creates fulfilling work environment / company culture\nA business is only as good as the people who run it. This is why having a healthy and positive company culture is so important. A positive company culture creates an environment where employees feel valued, fulfilled, aligned with company values, and motivated to achieve the company’s goals. Leaders play an important role in establishing and maintaining a positive company culture. They need to establish trust with employees by leading by example and getting staff excited about the company, its goals, and its vision.\n\n4. Resolve conflict\nConflict can ruin a business if left unchecked. There is a conflict between employees, teams, or departments, it affects productivity and the company’s ability to operate efficiently, and profitably. It is thus very important for leaders to resolve conflict as quickly and smoothly as possible. By engaging with those involved, they ensure that everyone feels heard, which can quickly defuse a situation. Conflict resolution also helps leaders to get insight into challenges that they might not be exposed to daily and allows them to come up with effective solutions to overcome these challenges.\n\n5. Provide guidance, inspiration & motivation\nThe main role of a leader is to lead. They guide the rest of the organization so that company goals can be achieved. But for a business to reach its goals and fulfill its vision, leaders must do more than just guide. Leaders must inspire and motivate staff by setting an example. It’s easier to get excited about something when your boss is excited about it. Acknowledgment is a huge motivator, so leaders need to acknowledge the achievements of employees, teams, and departments. This makes people feel like they’re making an actual contribution to the success of the company. \n\n6. Continuous improvement\nAs mentioned before, a company is only as good as the people it employs. Great employees can make a huge difference in making the company more efficient, more productive, and ultimately more profitable. Great leaders recognize this and understand that knowledge is key to developing staff to constantly improve because it gives people a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment. They create many learning opportunities and encourage employees to learn and grow.\n\n7. Provide support\nA key role of a leader is to provide support. Everything is not always smooth-sailing, and unforeseen challenges can put an unexpected strain on certain departments within a business. A leader in-tune with their organization will recognize when departments need support, identify what support it needs, and ensure that the appropriate support is provided. Providing support shows employees that business leadership is committed to the success of the entire business.\n\nBusiness leadership is arguably one of the most important factors in the running of a business, and it is difficult to imagine a successful business without great leadership. A business leader is more than just the head of the company. They establish the company’s tone and embody its vision, they inspire employees and create a culture where employees can flourish and grow, motivating them to work together toward achieving the company’s goals.\n\nGreat leaders can turn bad companies into good companies, and good companies into extraordinary ones.\n\n",

    title: "Measuring the marketing of your business",
    blurb:
      "Marketing can play a major role in the success of your business, but it’s important to determine whether your strategy is working.",
    body: "Marketing can play a major role in the success of your business. At its core, the role of marketing is to attract new customers and retain existing ones. This includes everything from traditional print and TV ads, to online advertising via banners, content or social media, webinars, or events and conferences. But no matter which marketing channel you use, it’s important to determine whether your strategy is working and that your money is well spent.\n\nBut before you start measuring your marketing performance, you should look at your marketing plan and determine what your goals are and what you deem to be successful. What are your marketing goals? Is it to build brand awareness or do you want to push sales? Is your aim to retain existing customers or attract new ones? The answers to these types of questions are important to put measurement results into perspective and make them useful, otherwise, the results are simply numbers.\n\nWHAT SHOULD YOU MEASURE?\nThere are several things you can measure, and you should use at least one of these if you want your marketing to be successful:\n\n1. Return on Investment\nSimply put, Return on investment (ROI) tells you how much money you made from the money you spent. Was the money you spent worth it? ROI is one of the most popular metrics to measure, but it can also be one of the most difficult. Something like brand love and awareness ultimately drives sales, but not necessarily directly, which makes it tricky to quantify, but not impossible. By cleverly analyzing things like historical data, the timing of sales increases, and the like, you can match marketing campaigns with sales trends.\n\n2. Social metrics\nSocial media is playing an increasingly important role in advertising with research suggesting that nearly 75% of marketers invest marketing dollars in social media marketing. Many businesses are moving away from traditional print, radio, and TV advertising completely, and solely focusing their marketing efforts on social media. The personal and direct nature of how users interact with social media means that marketing messages reach consumers directly. Social media platforms also collect a lot of data from their users, making it possible to pinpoint exactly the audience you want to serve your marketing messages to. \n\nWhat’s more, the wealth of user data also allows marketers to measure marketing campaigns to minute details. You can find out exactly who saw your marketing messages, how long they spent looking at them, and whether they interacted with them or clicked through to your business. In some cases, it’s even possible to measure whether the message resulted in a sale.\n\n3. Real-time business intelligence\nNo matter how good the research, marketing campaigns don’t always hit the mark. This is a problem for all marketers because once a campaign is set in motion, you have to wait until it’s over to gauge how the campaign performed, until now. Manufacturing businesses have been using business intelligence, or BI, to monitor their operations for years, but recent advances in software technology have made real-time (BI) immensely popular with marketers too. With a BI platform, you can monitor marketing campaigns as it is running. These marketers make adjustments during the campaign to ensure that it is most effective. BI is built around data, which also makes post-campaign analysis super easy and effective.\n\n4. Post-campaign analytic reports\nGenerating and analyzing post-campaign reports is extremely important as it allows marketers to determine whether the marketing campaign overall was an overall success. But no campaign is perfect, and post-campaign reports shed light on the less-effective elements of a campaign. This information can be used to improve and produce more effective future campaigns. Some tools like business intelligence platforms can generate post-campaign reports, but there are limits. Business intelligence is not necessarily suited to all types of campaigns, thus these reports should not be relied on solely for campaign feedback. Many businesses employ external agencies to generate reports and provide insights.\n\n5. Customer Relationship Management solutions (CRM)\nOne of the most useful tools for measuring campaign effectiveness is customer relationship management solutions or CRM. These solutions collect and analyze data from all customer interactions, like website and social media visits, phone calls, in-store visits, and the like, and provide valuable feedback regarding consumer engagement. This allows marketers to identify opportunities and improve marketing campaigns to better target both existing and prospective customers.\n\nMeasuring marketing performance is essential in creating marketing campaigns that let your business thrive. But measurement means nothing if you don’t have a follow-up strategy. You have all the information, now what are you going to do with it? The answer to that question is as important as the marketing campaign itself.",

    title: "Blockchain and data privacy: who owns your info? ",
    blurb:
      "Data security and ownership is a big concern and blockchain technology has been hailed as a data-security saviour",
    body: "In March 2018 news broke of political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica’s use of nearly 87 million Facebook users’ data in order to influence election results both in the US and abroad. This brought data security and ownership firmly into the public eye. In fact, since late 2018, Facebook itself has been embroiled in an ongoing slew of allegations claiming the social network provided private user data to large corporations to be used for pin-point targeted advertising.\n\nThese types of events may lead people to wonder whether corporations know more about them than they know themselves. After all, Cambridge Analytica admitted that they’ve got around 5,000 data points on each citizen in the US! It seems absurd, but considering the vast amount of information collected by websites, smartphones, smartwatches, and personal assistants like Alexa and Siri, it’s actually not that difficult to grasp. Of course, there is a debate about whether people actually own their personal data, or not.\n\nRegardless of the answer, people want more control over their personal data, who they allow access to it, and what is done with it. Blockchain technology might just be the answer.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why blockchain technology may be the key to data privacy:\n\nDecentralized and Distributed\nMany recent data breaches, such as that of Yahoo and Sony’s Playstation Network, originated from a centralized source, giving whoever is executing the breach access to a wealth of information all at once. A blockchain spreads over multiple sources in a decentralized manner, meaning that data does not reside in one particular place. This makes it less vulnerable to large-scale attacks, meaning that data is more secure.\n\nTransparency\nBlockchains are transparent by design. Each block of information is visible to everyone in the chain, making it easy for consumers to see exactly where their data comes from, who is using it, and what they’re using it for. It also allows users to see exactly where their data is. The transparency of the blockchain also means that users can see who adds data to the chain, and what happens to the data.\n\nSafe and Secure\nOne of the major features of blockchain technology is the reliance on extremely strong encryption, signatures, and time stamping. This combination makes it a very secure place to store and manage data. What’s more, users of the blockchain can decide what they do with their data, like sell it or share it with others. Unlike other data storage systems, blockchain technology gives users true ownership of their data.\n\nThe GDPR police\nIn May 2018 the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. These regulations are designed to protect the personal data of consumers in Europe and require not only European businesses, but businesses outside of Europe who deal with European customers, to adhere to a strict set of rules regarding personal data. These regulations include things like the right of consumers to know what personal data is stored, how it’s being used, and be notified when their data has been affected by a breach.\n\nSolving blockchain’s GDPR problem\nOne of the most important regulations as far as blockchain technology is concerned is the right of consumers to delete their data from the internet. This is a concern for blockchain owners, since data in the chain is immutable and cannot be changed, and even if it was possible, deleting a certain set of data will compromise the integrity of the entire chain — one of the major advantages of blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, private, or permission, blockchains may be the answer. In private blockchains, users need to have access to the chain in order to access data. Private blockchains also feature smart contracts that allow users to manage their data, with the ability to revoke access. This makes the content invisible to others, and thus more secure.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "Travelling is a great way to enrich your life. But when you’re in another country it’s important to be a responsible tourist.",
    body: "They say the only way to enrich your own culture is to lean over your borders and experience another.\n\nWith people from a great number of different cultures and beliefs living together in Cape Town, the city offers a unique experience that will most certainly leave you enriched, and perhaps even enlightened. However, while exploring different cultures, it’s important to do so responsibly. After all, these people open the arms of their city like guests in their homes.\n\nHere are ten ways in which you can be a responsible tourist:\n\n1. Do a little reading\nTaking some time to learn about the customs and traditions of the local people will go a long way in showing respect to your hosts. Learning a couple of phrases in the local language(s), even if you don’t pronounce them correctly, will undoubtedly make someone smile and is a great way to start a conversation.\n\n2. Take public transport\nThere are many different ways to get around Cape Town without a car - walking, metered taxis, minibus taxis, trains, and the city’s myCiti bus service will not only help to ease the load on Mother Nature, but you’ll get the opportunity to interact with real Capetonians who often have interesting stories to share.\n\n3. Respect the environment\nCape Town is known for its natural beauty, especially the immense biodiversity of Table Mountain and its surroundings. It’s a very delicate ecosystem so don’t just pick flowers or interesting plants while on a hike - it’s most often also illegal. Also, carry your litter with you until you find a suitable place to discard it.\n\n4. Be water wise\nSouth Africa has been experiencing one of the most severe droughts in recent history. The whole country is affected, and both locals and visitors are requested to use water sparingly. When you’re at your hotel, take a quick shower instead of a bath, don’t put towels in the laundry basket unless absolutely necessary, and be careful to close taps properly.\n\n5. Be mindful of animals\nAnimals are a big part of tourism in South Africa, and Cape Town is no exception - from the penguins at Boulders Beach, dassies on Table Mountain, and baboons around Cape Point. It’s important to remember that these are wild animals, and both they and their environments should be respected. Pay attention to signage about these animals, especially concerning dangerous animals - for instance, a baboon might look timid on TV, but in real life, they’re anything but.\n\n6. Don’t give money to beggars\nThere are many beggars and vagrants, many of them children, in Cape Town. It sounds harsh, but it’s best not to give in to their requests. If you really want to help, rather donate to one of the organizations in Cape Town that provide meals, shelter, and other services to the poor and homeless. This way you’ll know where your contributions are going and that you are making a real difference.\n\n7. Beware of voluntourism\nIt’s a growing trend among especially younger travelers to travel to most developing countries and volunteer in a community project of some sort. This is known as ‘voluntourism’, and while the debate around whether this practice actually does good for the community, there are a number of organizations that are profiting from these well-meaning volunteers, instead of the local communities. If you feel strongly about giving some of your time to a good cause, do some research on organizations in the area and contact them directly.\n\n8. Ask before taking people’s pictures\nThis almost goes without saying - when you’re taking someone’s picture you are invading their personal space in a way, so it’s just respectful to ask someone’s permission before you take their picture.\n\n9. Be careful what you buy\nWhen you buy souvenirs to take home to show your friends and remind you about your great adventure, be mindful not to buy products made of endangered plants or animals.\n\n10. Support local artists\nBuying souvenirs isn’t only a great way to remind you of your journey when you get home, but it also allows you to make a contribution to the local economy by supporting local artists. Whether it’s a wire animal from a street vendor or a piece of contemporary modern art from a gallery, Cape Town has something for everyone.\n\n",

      "Recently street art has been adding another voice to the transformation of Woodstock, just outside of Cape Town's CBD.",
    body: "From a once bustling seaside resort to a semi-industrial area and now a bustling hub of creativity and hip coffee shops, the suburb of Woodstock just outside the Cape Town CBD has seen its fair share of re-invention over the years. Recently street art has been adding another voice to the transformation process.\n\nA short history\nIt’s hard to imagine that in the middle of the 19th Century, Woodstock, the semi-industrial area on the outskirts of Cape Town’s CBD, was once a seaside resort comparable to Brighton in the UK. However, in the years that followed, Woodstock became increasingly industrialized, especially after the substantial land reclamations in the 1950s that robbed the suburb of its beach. With the coming and going of industry, crime started creeping into the area with the area a definite no-go zone for tourists and even locals.\n\nHowever, since the early 1990s Woodstock has undergone a gradual urban renewal process, especially in the last decade or so. These days Woodstock is undoubtedly the creative hub of the Mother City, with factories making way for artist studios, furniture showrooms, and creative agencies occupying much of the area, and hip and trendy coffee shops and eateries lining its streets.\n\nStreet Art Transformation\nDespite the great inroads made into the transformation of Woodstock, it is an ongoing process, and street art has played a major part in transforming the area into a safe and vibrant community while adding to its lively creative character. It is this transformation that lies at the heart of artist Juma Mkwela’s street art tour, a 60 to 90-minute guided walk through the alleys and streets of Woodstock. It is not the purpose of the art to change Woodstock, says Juma, but to help transform the area and bring more people into its streets – making it safer for everyone.\n\nThe Tour\nJuma is a friendly and cheerful host with an in-depth knowledge of the art that adorns the walls and buildings of Woodstock, as well as the artists who created them. His insightful stories provide an understanding not only of the art but of the meaning behind it and the role it plays in the area’s transformation. The majority of the art on display in the streets of Woodstock has some type of transformative message, from nature conservation to social justice, and general upliftment of the community, its social commentary is often provocative. The array of work is as vast and diverse as the artists that created them, both local and international, young and old, unknown and world-famous, who have come to put their mark on the walls of Woodstock.\n\nEverything changes\nThe nature of street art means that it is always changing, with new buildings, alterations, new gates and fences, and even vandals obscuring the art, and in some cases changing the meaning of what the artist originally intended. It’s this element that is often most fascinating to see, especially from Juma’s perspective. It also means that the tour is ever-changing and rewarding for repeat visits.\n\nA sense of community\nThe majority of the artwork is either done via proposal or commission and always with permission from the owners of the buildings on which the artwork is to be created. At the end of the day, the art on walls and buildings of Woodstock is about the community, to make the area a safer and more pleasant place for the most impoverished community who live just beyond the bustling streets full of hip coffee shops and hotshot agencies.\n\nJuma Mkwela’s Woodstock Street Art walking tour is a great way to not only appreciate great art but also see this positive transformation in progress.\n\nTours are 60 to 90 minutes depending on the size of the group and cover a loop that starts at the Woodstock Exchange.\n\n",

      "Managed services providers provide cost-effective, robust and secure IT solutions. Here’s how they can make your life easier.",
    body: "In the information age, a reliable and secure IT platform is essential for business growth. However, very few SMBs have the capacity or resources to establish and maintain such an infrastructure. Managed services providers allow business owners to focus on strategic tasks by providing cost-effective, robust, and secure IT solutions. Here’s a look at how MSPs can make your life as an SMB owner much easier.\n\nHelps your business scale effectively\nManaged Services Providers (MSP) are not only experts at establishing the best possible systems solutions that plug into your existing IT infrastructure, but also developing these solutions to facilitate effective and reliable scaling of your business. They achieve this by offering robust subscription-based SaaS and IaaS solutions that allow you to easily scale your business at your own pace by simply increasing subscriptions, and letting the MSP take care of the rest.\n\nAdaptable to specific needs\nBeing able to adapt quickly to changing markets is key to taking full advantage of new and existing opportunities like holiday and seasonal sales fluctuations and unexpected events. An MSP creates a flexible environment that allows you to harness the full potential of your business systems and infrastructure to aid in effectively identifying, navigating, and benefitting from these opportunities.\n\nExperts are always available\nIT systems don’t keep to a 9-to-5 schedule, and when problems arise the downtime can be costly, especially for those with international customers. Few small businesses have dedicated IT teams to deal with these situations, and many rely on employees whose expertise actually lies elsewhere. This may potentially cause unnecessary downtime when complex problems are encountered. It is thus important to have round-the-clock access to experts that can quickly solve problems if and when they arise. A trusted MSP not only provides support any time of day or night but also access to experienced experts that are able to troubleshoot and solve problems quickly, keeping downtime to an absolute minimum.\n\nAlways up-to-date\nUp-to-date hardware and software allow your systems to run at their optimal capacity, allowing you to tap into the full potential it holds. An MSP manages software and firmware updates, as well as license compliance, keeping your systems running smoothly, securely, and functioning properly. This results in fewer problems, greater longevity, and easier audits. They also proactively search and fix potential problem areas.\n\nTighter security\nSystem security is one of the top concerns for any business owner. You want to have the confidence that your valuable documents and data are safe, secure, and protected from theft and data loss. MSPs provide increased security through constant monitoring, frequent backups, and cutting-edge virus, spyware, and malware protection protocols. A proactive approach is followed to identify flaws and potential security threats in the system and patch them before a disaster strikes.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "GPS is one of the most important technologies of our time, but how do these devices work?",
    body: "Global Positioning System, or GPS, is a way to accurately determine the location of something on earth and is considered one of the most important technologies of our time. It uses a combination of satellites and receivers to pinpoint the geolocation of these receivers along longitude and latitude coördinates. Information is supplied by around 30 purpose-built satellites orbiting the earth in fixed orbits. This information can then be interpreted by software that can display the position in a more user-friendly way by using map overlays. \n\nGPS has myriad applications, including military, and civilian transport navigating, personal navigation, map making, climate studies, emergency location, as well as commercial applications such as fleet monitoring and courier tracking.\n\nA SHORT HISTORY\nInitially developed by the United States Department of Defence, work on the system that would eventually become GPS as we know it today, started all the way back in 1957 when two physicists from Johns Hopkins University decided to monitor the radio signals from the recently launched Russian satellite, Sputnik 1. By using the Doppler effect, the change in frequency of a wave as it moves closer or farther away from its source, they discovered that they could track the position of the satellite as it orbited the earth. The potential application of this ability was apparent, and a project was launched to reverse the technology to track objects on Earth.\n\nHowever, only in 1973 did military officials realize the significant practical applications of this kind of system, such as tracking ships, planes, and weapons. A project to develop what we know as GPS today was launched. By 1980, the system was opened for civilian use, but only on a limited basis. The program launched prototype satellites between 1978 and 1985. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan issued a directive that the system should be opened for civilian use once developed. By 1995, one year after the system became completely operational, President Bill Clinton signed a policy to open up the limited availability of the system for civilian use. This was eventually done in 2000, and since then use of GPS has soared and has been playing an increasingly significant role in everyday life.\n\nWhile GPS is open to the private sector, the US government still owns and operates the network, and it is required by international law that the US Department of Defence continuously maintains the service globally.\n\nHOW GPS WORKS\nThe GPS consists of satellites and receivers and works on what is known as trilateration, a mathematical principle that measures distance by using the geometry of shapes like circles, spheres, or triangles. For a GPS system to work, receivers must know the location of at least three satellites, as well as the distance of these satellites from the receiver. This triangulation creates a 3-dimensional image of exactly where the receiver is located, including the direction and speed at which it is traveling, as well as the time. \n\nThere are 24 active GPS satellites at any given time, orbiting the earth every 12 hours. Several ‘backup’ satellites can be activated in case one of the 24 fails. This network of satellites is known as the Global Navigation Satellite System, or GNSS.\n\nWhile GPS operates independently of telecommunications networks, these can be used to enhance the accuracy of the system, as well as communicate and analyze data for various applications.\n\nTYPES OF RECEIVERS\nThere are different types of GPS receivers, with data loggers, data pushers, and data receivers being the most popular. Each of these is suited to different applications. The most popular of these are data loggers and data pushers. \n\nData loggers (Passive tracking)\nKnown as passive tracking, data loggers log and store data such as time, location, and various types of events on the device’s internal flash memory or memory card, at pre-determined intervals. This information can then be downloaded for analysis via a USB port or removable storage device, such as a memory card. Some data loggers send information wirelessly at certain intervals. This type of GPS tracking is often used in cameras to create geolocation and time tags on photographs. \n\nData Pushers (Active tracking)\nThe most common type of GPS tracking unit is called a data pusher, or GPS beacon. These types of trackers allow for active tracking by automatically ‘pushing’ data to a centralized server in real-time. Active tracking allows for instant analysis of tracked data, and is particularly useful in security applications such as vehicle and cellphone or computer tracking in the event of theft, as it provides authorities with the exact location of a vehicle. Other applications include monitoring commercial fleets, tracking people like children and athletes at sporting events, as well as tracking courier deliveries.\n\nData Pullers\nAlso known as GPS transponders, these units are always active, and differ from data pushers in that they don’t send information to a centralized server, but rather are queried by systems when needed. This is known as pull technology. This type of unit is not in wide use and is usually installed on property that runs the risk of theft, or where a constant power source isn’t available, such as freight containers. While not currently not very common, it is gaining popularity due to the pairing of transponders with cellular phones that respond to special text messages.\n\nOn-board Diagnostics Trackers\nOn-board Diagnostics GPS trackers, or OBD GPS trackers, are GPS units that plug directly into a vehicle’s diagnostic port. These types of trackers are designed to gather much more detailed information about the vehicle than simply time, place, speed, and direction. It includes things like fuel consumption, performance, wear and tear, and other diagnostic information. The unit uses its built-in antenna to transmit this data to a remote server, where it can be viewed and monitored. This type of GPS tracker is especially popular in light to medium commercial vehicles.\n\nUSES OF GPS TRACKERS IN VEHICLES\nThere is a common misperception that GPS trackers and navigation systems are the same. While they essentially work on the same principle and use the same technology, navigation systems provide location and driving directions, whereas GPS trackers either gather data about things like driving habits or provide real-time location data. These are often used in combination, known as telematics. This is tremendously useful for businesses that own and use fleets of vehicles, as well as vehicle security.\n\nIn commercial fleets, GPS is mainly used to keep track of where vehicles are, routes are driven, the general health of the vehicle, and mileage data for financial and maintenance reasons. Some units are also programmed to be triggered by certain events such as ignition, opening or closing of doors, especially freight and delivery vehicles, speeding, when the vehicle enters certain geographical areas, or when vehicles deviate from a set route. This kind of application leads to greater employee accountability and driver efficiency. Purpose-built software is often used for monitoring and analysis to make routes more efficient, or find vehicles in case of theft. \n\nA major use of GPS in both fleets and private vehicles are security and theft tracking. GPS units are often hidden in the vehicle by specialist companies. Many insurers require the installation of such devices as a requirement for insuring certain types of vehicles. Some insurers even use driving behavior to determine the risk level of a customer. This is used to determine premiums, and also down on false or inaccurate reporting on claims.\n\nTHE LEGALITY OF GPS TRACKING\nGPS tracking is a contentious issue, with many worried about invasion of privacy, monitoring by authorities, or surveillance by other parties such as private investigators. With many web-based applications that can use tracking information, cyberstalking is always a concern. Every country has its own set of laws governing GPS tracking, but these laws are generally very similar. As a rule, you can track a vehicle or item if it belongs to you or a company. If it’s not your property, it’s usually illegal to install any kind of tracking device, unless specifically requested or agreed on by the owner. Thankfully the overwhelming majority of commercial applications fall well within the boundaries of the law. If you’re not sure, you should seek professional legal advice. \n\nGPS technology is one of the greatest, and most useful technologies of our time, and after more than half a century of development, the system has become such a part of our lives that we almost take it for granted. One of the most useful applications of the technology is undoubtedly in vehicles, with GPS making it easier to get from Point A to Point B, making fleets more efficient and businesses more cost-effective, to countering theft. As both automotive and GPS technology evolves, the use of GPS will only increase.\n\n",

      "What would happen if your business fell pray to a ransomware attack, and how can you ensure your business data is protected?",
    body: "When we hear of cyber attacks, it’s often on large corporates and institutions that grab the headlines, but a recent ransomware attack left nearly a quarter of a million computers, from home computers to enterprise workstations, all around the world almost unusable. This makes it critically important to ensure your business data is protected.\n\nWhat is ransomware, why is it so dangerous, and what can you do to protect your business?\n\nRansom-what?!\nComputer viruses have been around for a very long time, and the internet has made it even easier for these malicious pieces of software to spread. One such type of software is called ransomware, which essentially holds your data hostage by blocking access to your data, and either threatens to destroy it, or publish it if it’s particularly sensitive. The only way for your data to get ‘released’ is to pay a ransom, hence the name. Ransomware has been gaining in popularity in recent years, especially with the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin which makes tracking funds virtually impossible. Worms and trojans are the most popular types of ‘vehicles’ for infection. In computer terms, a trojan is a piece of code disguised as something else, such as a pop-up window or fake email message, which is then downloaded onto a computer. A worm, on the other hand, usually enters a computer through a security vulnerability in a network and replicates itself to spread to other computers on a network using the same vulnerability.\n\nDo you WannaCry?\nIn May 2017, the ransomware crypto worm (a highly encrypted version of a worm) hit more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries, infecting computers of Spain’s Telefónica, Germany’s railway service Deutsche Bahn, FedEx, and most alarmingly, Britain’s National Health Service, where not only computers but also things like MRI scanners, theatre, and blood-storage equipment were rendered useless.\n\nBut it’s not just big companies that got hit, WannaCry also spread to thousands of personal computers, demanding a ransom of a certain amount of Bitcoin to ‘release’ the computer’s data. This ransom had to be paid within three days, or else the ransom amount would double. WannaCry exploited a vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol of Microsoft Windows, one of which Microsoft was not initially aware, and predominantly hit computers running the Windows 7 operating system. Thankfully a so-called killswitch was found within WannaCry’s code, which slowed its progress significantly until a way could be found to stop it.\n\nHolding your business ransom\nAs mentioned before, it’s not only big businesses that can be affected by ransomware but even small businesses and individuals who are at risk. And while you might think that you can overcome ransomware by simply paying the ransom, it’s not a guarantee that you will get your data back! Thankfully there are several ways in which you can protect your IT systems from not only ransomware but other malware and cyberattacks.\n\nDon’t open for strangers\nInternally, one of the most important things you can do is be vigilant of potential threats. This includes being aware of suspicious emails, websites, and applications and running anti-virus software whenever using external devices on office computers. Encourage your employees to report anything strange or suspicious immediately.\n\nBackups, updates, and patches\nData security also relies on a well-managed IT infrastructure. Up-to-date system and software updates and patches will ensure your systems are protected from within, while regular, securely stored backups will ensure you’re up and running in the unfortunate event that something evil does slip through the cracks.\n\nCall the cavalry\nArguably the best defense against potential threats is to call in IT security specialists who can provide you with specialized software that is custom-built to protect your business’s IT infrastructure from threats both outside and from within. These specialists will identify specific threats to your business, and inspect your system to find vulnerabilities and fix them.\n\nHire some heavies\nEnsuring your IT system is secure and protected at all times can seem like a daunting task, but it’s a very important one that simply cannot be overlooked. A managed services provider (MSP) has all the experience, tools, and know-how to give you complete peace of mind. An MSP will ensure your systems are always up-to-date, provide secure backup and recovery solutions tailored to your specific needs, and ensure that your business is protected by the latest, state-of-the-art software and protocols.\n\n",

    blurb:
      "If your business is relying on old hardware and outdated software it not only hampers creativity, but may also put you at risk.",
    body: "Technology moves at an incredibly rapid pace, and it’s sometimes hard to keep up, especially in the current economic climate where cash flow is tight. However, running old hardware and outdated software not only hampers creativity but may also pose a security risk. Here’s a look at some of the risks involved in relying on old tech.\n\nWhen to retire tech\nKnowing exactly when to replace or upgrade your business technology is important, but it’s also a tricky one with so many factors at play. The generally expected lifespan of hardware is usually between three to five years for desktop computers, depending on the type of usage, and two to four years for laptops. On the other hand, when the software stops being supported by the manufacturer or vendor, or when it can no longer work or be synced with newer devices or the cloud, then it’s time for an upgrade. Replacement or upgrades also depends on the hierarchy of systems and employees most reliant on technology.\n\nBeware: Old hardware\nSome of the main risks of relying on outdated hardware are failure and support. As hardware ages, support and availability of parts can become an issue, increasing repair costs. You also run the risk of losing data when an old hard drive fails, or electronic components wear out. Upgrades may also improve reliability, as solid-state drives are far more robust than older hard disc drives which lead to a lower risk of data loss. This is especially true for laptops that need to withstand the bumps of life on the road. Old hardware may also not meet the minimum requirements of updated software that is essential to the proper running of your business, such as collaboration and cloud computing software.\n\nTo cloud or not to cloud\nCloud computing has come to the rescue of not only those who need to access data on the road but also the security of hardware like servers and desktop computers. The cloud is a reliable solution that minimizes potential data loss due to hardware failure and/or theft by keeping it offsite, always available, and secure. The technology behind the cloud is ever-evolving, making systems more efficient and more secure by making it easier for hosts to keep the service up to date with the latest tech.\n\nHard times with old software\nThey say that hardware is nothing without software, and out-of-date software can perhaps pose an even greater security risk for your business. As software vendors introduce new versions, operating systems, in particular, stop supporting certain older versions, and thereby no longer sending updates with bug fixes and security patches that are critical in keeping the software running smoothly and securely. When bugs in older, unsupported, software cause the software to crash, it can lead to unnecessary downtime, or worse, loss of valuable data. Thankfully most software developers are moving towards a subscription model for their software, making it easier for businesses to stay up to date with the latest updates without large capital expenditure.\n\nOld policies for old tech\nEven if your business tech is up to date and up to speed, if IT policies are not updated to include the new tech, it can have a negative impact on productivity. Out-of-date policies may not include things like tablets and other smart devices, BYOD (bring your own device), cloud access, and the like, and can make it difficult for employees to perform their tasks effectively and efficiently. In some instances, these policies may cause employees to turn to unapproved applications as a workaround, leading to potential security issues.\n\n",

    title: "Uncovering the hidden potential of dark data",
    blurb:
      "Dark data is the seemingly meaningless and disparate bits of information that lurks in the dark corners of your server.",
    body: "Tim Brenners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web once said, “Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.” Wise words in the age of Big Data, where innumerable amounts of data about virtually everything are collected every second of every day. With the help of complex business intelligence (BI) systems, these mountains of data get crunched and analyzed and help optimize workflow that facilitates business growth.\n\nHowever, not all data gets analyzed and large chunks are relegated to the far corners of networks where they end up unstructured and unsecure [this is not a typo]. As a matter of fact, according to reports*, only use a fraction of the data that businesses collect, is actually analyzed. As a result, this forgotten dark data may hold tremendous value, and in the right hands, it can not only allow your business to reach its full potential but also make it more secure.\n\nWhat exactly is dark data?\nWith the seemingly innumerable streams of data being generated and collected every day, not all of it is used for specific purposes, makes the cut when analysts mine for insights, or is difficult to analyze. In fact, many businesses often collect data that they don’t even know they’re collecting - things like social media posts, wi-fi router logs, meeting minutes, email threads, research, presentations, and video files - these are what are called dark data.\n\nThe problem with dark data\nAside from taking up storage space, dark data may contain sensitive information such as financial records, employee records, business practices, information on former business agreements, information on intellectual property, and the like. The unstructured nature of dark data, makes it difficult to monitor and control, which up the business to data theft, and potentially makes it a lucrative target for cybercriminals.\n\nGetting the most out of it\nIt’s not all doom and gloom, though, and there are many ways to manage dark data and minimise its risk. Having a well-developed and clearly defined data governance plays an important part, especially from a security point of view. Data verification and designated data quality accountability processes can identify sensitive information to be secured through strong encryption, clearly defined retention and disposal protocols, as well as regular, thorough data audits, these are some of the governance measures that can be used to ensure not only dark data but overall data security.\n\nThe need for speed\nGetting the most out of dark data relies on catching and analyzing data before it goes dark, as well as the ability to extract and analyze existing, unstructured (dark) data. Speed is of the essence and real-time analysis is vital in reducing the amount of data going dark, and also harnessing the benefits of this data that would otherwise have gone dark.\n\nDue to this, fast and powerful BI solutions are needed that can not only handle large volumes of data but can do so in real time. Like a car losing a big portion of its value the moment it drives off the showroom floor and continues to depreciate the longer you drive it, so too does data start to lose its real-time value as soon as it gets stored, hence the need for speedy analysis. This is where the true power of dark data lies, the ability to identify it based on existing dark data and analyze it in real time. For example, by analyzing seemingly meaningless data from a store’s wi-fi routers, high foot-traffic patterns can be identified, and leveraged to create opportunities for increased sales. If, however, this data is allowed to sit there for a while, it causes it to lose its relevance (value) and inevitably goes dark.\n\nWhile dark data may sound scary, and perhaps seem insignificant, when it gets integrated into regular, big data, it may result in a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMcKinsey & Company - The internet of things: Mapping the value beyond the hype. 2015.\n\n",
